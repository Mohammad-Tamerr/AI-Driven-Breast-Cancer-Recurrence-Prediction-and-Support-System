This booklet was designed to explain some of the medical terms doctors may use when talking about your cancer \\nand help you keep track of the specifics of your breast cancer diagnosis and treatment plan. Throughout this guide, you will \\nfind questions to ask your doctor, nurse, or another member of your health care team, as well as plenty of space to write \\ndown their answers or other important information. There are also check boxes you can use to identify the tests, procedures, \\nand treatments that will make up your cancer care plan. \\nHowever you choose to keep track of this information, it is important to do so. Getting the facts about your diagnosis will \\nhelp you make the best decisions based on your situation in the coming days. Additionally, being an informed, involved \\npatient and voicing your questions and concerns will help you and your health care team form a partnership in your care. \\nTell your doctor and nurse how you prefer to receive information and how much you want to know about your diagnosis, \\ntreatment, and prognosis, which is the chance of recovery.

Within this tissue is \\na network of lobes, which are made up of small, tube-like structures called lobules that contain milk glands. Tiny ducts \\nconnect the glands, lobules, and lobes, carrying the milk from the lobes to the nipple. The nipple is located in the middle of \\nthe areola, which is the darker area that surrounds the nipple. Blood and lymph vessels also run throughout the breast. Blood \\nnourishes the cells, and the lymphatic system drains bodily waste products. The lymph vessels connect to lymph nodes, \\nwhich are tiny, bean-shaped organs that help fight infection. \\nBreast cancer \\nis the most \\ncommon \\ncancer in \\nwomen \\n(excluding \\nskin cancer), \\nbut men \\ncan also be \\ndiagnosed\\n. \\nBreast cancer development\\n \\nBreast cancer begins when healthy cells \\nin the breast change and grow out of \\ncontrol, forming a mass called a tumor. \\nA tumor can be cancerous or benign. A \\ncancerous tumor is malignant, meaning \\nit can spread to other parts of the body. \\nA benign tumor can grow but does not \\nspread to other parts of the body, and it \\nis rarely life-threatening. \\nTypes of breast cancer \\nBreast cancer can be invasive or noninvasive. Invasive breast cancer is cancer that \\nspreads into surrounding tissues. Noninvasive breast cancer does not go beyond \\nthe milk ducts or lobules in the\\xa0breast. Most breast cancers start in the ducts, \\ncalled ductal carcinoma, or in the lobules, called lobular carcinoma. A pathologist \\ndetermines whether a tumor removed during a biopsy is ductal or lobular cancer. \\nA pathologist is a doctor who specializes in interpreting laboratory tests and \\nevaluating cells, tissues, and organs to diagnose disease. \\nIf the disease has spread outside the duct or lobule and into the surrounding \\ntissue, it is called invasive or infiltrating ductal or lobular carcinoma. Cancer that \\nis located only in the duct or lobule is called in situ, meaning “in place,” and \\nis noninvasive. Most in situ breast cancers are ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). \\nDCIS is often treated with surgery, radiation therapy, and hormonal therapy \\n(see “Breast Cancer Treatment,” p. 14). Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is not'),\n",

To reduce this risk, LCIS is \\nsometimes treated with hormonal therapy. \\nOther less common types of breast cancer include medullary, \\nmucinous, tubular, metaplastic, and papillary breast cancer, as \\nwell as other even rarer types. Inflammatory breast cancer is a \\nfaster growing type of cancer that accounts for about 1% to 5% \\nof all breast cancers. At first it may be misdiagnosed as a breast \\ninfection because there is often swelling of the breast and \\nredness of the breast skin that starts suddenly, and there may \\nbe no breast mass or lump. Paget’s disease is a type of cancer \\nthat begins in the ducts of the nipple. The skin often appears \\nscaly and may be itchy. Although it is usually in situ, it can also \\nbe an invasive cancer. \\nBreast cancer spread \\nAs a cancerous breast tumor grows, cancer cells may break \\naway and be carried to other parts of the body through \\nthe bloodstream or lymphatic system. During this process, \\nknown as metastasis, the cancer cells can grow and develop \\nin new locations in the body. One of the first places breast \\ncancer usually spreads is to the regional lymph nodes \\nlocated under the arm, in the neck, under the chest bone, or \\njust above the collarbone. \\nBreast cancer can also spread farther away from the breast \\nto other parts of the body, such as the bones, lungs, and \\nliver. Less often, breast cancer may spread to the brain. Breast \\ncancer that has spread to a distant location in the body is \\nreferred to as stage IV or metastatic breast cancer.

These are commonly shortened to \\nBRCA1 or BRCA2. A mutation in either of these genes gives \\na woman an increased risk of developing breast and/or \\novarian cancer, as well as other types of cancer. Men who \\ninherit these gene mutations also have an increased risk of \\ndeveloping breast cancer, as well as prostate cancer. \\nOther gene mutations or hereditary conditions can increase \\na person’s risk of breast cancer.

After this, the doctor will use a number of \\ntests and procedures to determine whether the mass is \\ncancerous and, if it is, to figure out if the cancer has spread. \\nNot every test is right for every person.

The x-ray films produced by mammography, called \\nmammograms, help doctors find small tumors or irregularities in the breast. Diagnostic mammography is similar to \\nscreening mammography except that more pictures are taken, and it is often used when a woman is experiencing signs, \\nsuch as nipple discharge or a new lump. Diagnostic mammography may also be used if something suspicious is found on \\na screening mammogram. \\n\\x86 Ultrasound \\nAn ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the breast tissue. An ultrasound can distinguish \\nbetween a solid mass, which may be cancer, and a fluid-filled cyst, which is usually not cancer. \\n\\x86 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) \\nAn MRI uses magnetic fields, not x-rays, to produce detailed images of the body. An MRI can also be used to measure a tumor’s \\nsize. A special dye called a contrast medium is injected into a patient’s vein or given as a liquid to swallow before the scan to \\nhelp create a clearer picture of the possible cancer. A breast MRI may be used after a woman has been diagnosed with cancer \\nto check the other breast for cancer or to find out how much the disease has grown throughout the breast. It may also be \\nused before surgery to find out if chemotherapy is working to shrink the tumor.'),\n",

Other tests can suggest \\nthat cancer is present, but only a biopsy can make a definite \\ndiagnosis. There are different types of biopsies, classified by \\nthe technique and/or size of the needle used to collect the \\ntissue sample. \\n\\x86 Fine needle aspiration biopsy \\nThis type of biopsy uses a thin needle to remove a small \\nsample of cells from a suspicious lump. \\n\\x86 Core needle biopsy \\nThis procedure uses a thicker needle to remove a larger \\nsample of tissue. It is usually the preferred biopsy technique \\nto find out whether an abnormality discovered during a \\nphysical examination or on an imaging test is cancer. A \\nvacuum-assisted biopsy removes several large cores of \\ntissue. Medication to block the awareness of pain, called \\nlocal anesthesia, is used to reduce a person’s discomfort \\nduring the procedure. \\n KAREN ELSHOUT PHOTOGRAPH \\n\\x86 Image-guided biopsy \\nThis test is done when a distinct lump can’t be felt, but \\nan abnormality is seen with an imaging test, such as on a \\nmammogram. An image-guided biopsy can be done using \\na fine needle, core needle, or vacuum-assisted needle, \\ndepending on the amount of tissue that needs to be \\nremoved. During the procedure, the needle is guided to the \\nbest location with the help of an imaging technique, such \\nas mammography, ultrasound, or MRI. A stereotactic biopsy \\nis done using mammography to help guide the needle. A \\nsmall metal clip may be put into the breast to mark where the \\nbiopsy sample was taken in case the tissue is cancerous and \\nmore surgery is needed. This clip is usually titanium so it will \\nnot cause problems with future imaging tests, but check with \\nyour doctor before you have any additional tests or scans. \\n\\x86 Surgical biopsy \\nThis type of biopsy removes the largest amount of tissue. \\nA surgical biopsy is either incisional if it removes part of the \\nlump or excisional if it removes the entire lump. Because \\nsurgery is best done after a cancer diagnosis has been made, \\na surgical biopsy is usually not the recommended procedure \\nfor diagnosing breast cancer.

This is done to identify \\nspecific genes, proteins, and other factors unique to your \\ntumor. The standard tests used to further evaluate invasive \\nbreast cancer include estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone \\nreceptor (PR), and HER2 tests. ER status is often determined \\nfor DCIS as well. \\n\\x86 ER and PR status \\nAbout 60% to 75% of breast cancers have estrogen and/or \\nprogesterone receptors. Breast cancer cells with these \\nreceptors depend on the hormones estrogen and/or \\nprogesterone to grow. The presence of these receptors \\nhelps determine the risk of the cancer coming back after \\ntreatment and the type of treatment most likely to lower this \\nrisk. Generally, hormonal therapy works well for ER-positive \\nand/or PR-positive cancers, also called hormone receptor-\\npositive cancers. \\n\\x86 HER2 status \\nAbout 20% to 25% of breast cancers have more copies than \\nusual of a gene called the human epidermal growth factor \\nreceptor 2 (HER2). Because this gene makes a protein that \\nfuels tumor cell growth, HER2-positive cancers may grow \\nmore quickly. The tumor’s HER2 status also helps determine \\nwhether drugs that target the HER2 might help treat the \\ncancer. These drugs include trastuzumab (Herceptin), \\npertuzumab (Perjeta), lapatinib (Tykerb), and neratinib \\n(Nerlynx). About 50% of HER2-positive tumors also have \\nhormone receptors, so patients can benefit from both \\ntypes of treatment. \\n\\x86 Triple-negative \\nIf a tumor does not express ER, PR, or HER2, the tumor is \\ncalled “triple-negative.” Triple-negative breast cancer makes \\nup about 15% of invasive breast cancers. Triple-negative \\nbreast cancer may be more common among younger \\nwomen, particularly younger black women. Triple-negative \\ncancer is also more common in women with a mutation \\nin the BRCA1  and BRCA2 genes. Experts recommend that \\nall people with triple-negative breast cancer be tested for \\nBRCA gene mutations. \\nGenomic testing of the tumor \\nTests that look at the biology of a tumor are sometimes \\nused to understand more about breast cancer, especially if \\nthe cancer has not spread to other parts of the body. These \\ntests can help choose the most effective type of treatment, \\npredict the risk of recurrence, and avoid possible side \\neffects of a treatment that is not likely to work well. \\nThe most common genomic test in the United States is \\ncalled Oncotype DX. This test evaluates 16 cancer-related \\ngenes and 5 reference genes to estimate the risk of the \\ncancer coming back in a place other than the breast and \\nnearby lymph nodes within 10 years after diagnosis. \\nThis test is usually used for patients with stage I or stage II \\nER-positive breast cancer. These results are mainly used to \\nhelp doctors decide whether chemotherapy should be \\nadded to treatment with hormonal therapy. \\nThere are other types of genomic tests that are less often \\nused. These include Breast Cancer Index, MammaPrint, and \\nProsigna (formerly called a PAM50 test).'),\n",

The disease is only in the ducts and/or lobules \\nof the breast and has not spread to the surrounding breast \\ntissue. It is also called in situ or noninvasive cancer. \\nStage IA. The tumor is small and invasive, but it has not \\nspread to the lymph nodes. \\nStage IB.

The cancer has either of the following \\ncharacteristics: \\n• The tumor is between 20 mm and 50 mm and has spread \\nto 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes. \\n• The tumor is larger than 50 mm but has not spread to the \\naxillary lymph nodes. \\nStage IIIA.  The tumor may be any size, but it has spread \\nto 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes or to internal mammary \\nlymph nodes. It has not spread to other parts of the body. \\nStage IIIA may also describe a tumor larger than 50 mm that \\nhas spread to small areas of cancer in the lymph nodes. \\nStage IIIB.

Your surgical oncologist will guide you in the \\ndecision of what kind of surgery to consider and which \\nchoices are preferred depending on you and your breast \\ncancer diagnosis. Generally, the smaller the tumor, the \\nmore surgical options a person has. These options include: \\n\\x86 Lumpectomy \\nThis surgery removes the tumor as well as a small, cancer-\\nfree margin around it. Most of the breast remains. For \\ninvasive cancer, radiation therapy to the remaining breast \\ntissue is generally recommended after surgery. For DCIS, \\nradiation therapy after surgery may be an option depending \\non the patient and the tumor. A lumpectomy may also be \\ncalled breast-conserving surgery, a partial mastectomy, \\nquadrantectomy, or a segmental mastectomy. \\n\\x86 Mastectomy \\nThis surgery removes the entire breast and may or may not \\nbe combined with reconstructive surgery. There are several \\ntypes of mastectomies, and some can preserve the skin \\n(called a skin-sparing mastectomy) and the nipple (called a \\ntotal skin-sparing mastectomy). \\nSurgery is also used to evaluate nearby lymph nodes \\nfor cancer cells. This helps the doctor decide the most \\nappropriate treatment. Lymph nodes serve as collecting \\nstations for lymph, a clear fluid that flows throughout the \\nbody. As lymph drains out of the breast and into nearby \\nlymph nodes, it can transport cancer cells that may have \\ndetached from the original tumor before it was removed. \\nIf there is cancer in the lymph nodes, the cancer is called \\nlymph node-positive breast cancer or node-positive, for \\nshort. If there is no cancer in the lymph nodes, the cancer is \\ncalled lymph node-negative breast cancer or node-negative. \\nThe type of procedure you have will depend on a variety \\nof factors, including the type of breast cancer and whether \\nthere is obvious evidence of cancer in the lymph nodes \\nbefore surgery.

Sentinel \\nlymph nodes are the first lymph nodes that are likely to \\ncollect cancer cells that have broken away from a tumor. \\nThe pathologist then examines these lymph nodes for \\ncancer cells. To find the sentinel lymph nodes, the surgeon \\ninjects a dye and/or a radioactive tracer into the area of the \\ncancer and/or around the nipple. The dye or tracer travels \\nto the lymph nodes, arriving at the sentinel nodes first. The \\nsurgeon can find these nodes when they change color (if the \\ndye is used) or gives off radiation (if the tracer is used). \\nIf the sentinel lymph nodes are cancer-free, research has \\nshown that there is a good possibility that the remaining \\nlymph nodes will also be free of cancer and no further surgery \\nwill be needed. If the sentinel lymph nodes show evidence \\nof cancer, usually no further surgery is needed. However, \\nthe surgeon may consider a dissection of the axillary lymph \\nnodes, located under the arms, to look for additional cancer \\ncells, depending on the type of breast surgery planned, the \\nstage of the cancer, and the number of cancer cells found in \\nthe sentinel lymph nodes. \\n\\x86 Axillary lymph node dissection \\nDuring an axillary lymph node dissection, the surgeon \\nremoves many lymph nodes from under the arm, which are \\nthen examined by a pathologist for cancer cells. Researchers \\nhave found that an axillary lymph node dissection may not \\nbe needed for all women with early-stage breast cancer \\nwho have small amounts of cancer in the sentinel lymph \\nnodes. Women having a lumpectomy and radiation therapy \\nwho have a smaller tumor and no more than 2 sentinel \\nlymph nodes with cancer may avoid a full axillary lymph \\nnode dissection, which helps reduce the risk of side effects \\nand does not decrease survival. \\nAfter a mastectomy or lumpectomy, the breast may be \\nscarred and may have a different shape or size than before \\nsurgery. The area around the surgical site may also become \\nharder. If any lymph nodes were removed as part of the \\nsurgery, or were affected during treatment, lymphedema \\nBILL WIPPERT \\nmay occur.

A doctor who specializes \\nin giving radiation therapy to treat cancer is called a \\nradiation oncologist. \\nThe most common type of radiation therapy used to treat \\nbreast cancer is external-beam radiation therapy. It delivers \\nradiation from a machine located outside the body. Other \\ntypes of radiation therapy, such as intra-operative radiation \\ntherapy and brachytherapy, are used less often to treat \\nbreast cancer. \\nRADIATION THERAPY AFTER LUMPECTOMY \\nRadiation therapy is most often given after a lumpectomy \\nto help lower the risk of recurrence in the breast. \\nStandard radiation therapy after a lumpectomy is external-\\nbeam radiation therapy given Monday through Friday for 3 to \\n6 weeks. This often includes radiation therapy to the whole \\nbreast for the first few weeks, followed by a more focused \\ntreatment, called a boost, to the area in the breast where the \\ntumor was located for the remaining treatments. For women \\nwith a low risk of recurrence, the boost may be optional. \\nSome centers are studying and using a 5-day schedule of \\naccelerated partial breast radiation (PBI), a technique in which \\nradiation is given only to the tumor area and not the entire \\nbreast. It is important to discuss these treatment approaches \\nwith your doctor. \\nRADIATION THERAPY AFTER MASTECTOMY \\nRadiation therapy may also be recommended for some \\nwomen after a mastectomy, depending on her age; the size \\nof the tumor; the number of lymph nodes under the arm \\nthat contain cancer; the width of healthy tissue around the \\ntumor removed by the surgeon; the ER, PR, and HER2 status \\nof the tumor; and other factors. This treatment is given to \\nthe chest wall, Monday through Friday, for 5 to 6 weeks. \\nRarely, radiation therapy may be given before surgery to \\nshrink a large tumor, making it easier to remove. \\nRADIATION THERAPY SIDE EFFECTS \\nRadiation therapy causes side effects, including fatigue, \\nswelling of the breast, redness and/or skin discoloration, \\nand pain and/or burning in the skin where the radiation was \\ndirected, sometimes with blistering or peeling. Very rarely, \\na small amount of the lung can be affected by the radiation, \\ncausing pneumonitis, radiation-related inflammation of \\nthe lung tissue. Some people experience breathlessness, a \\ndry cough, and/or chest pain 2 to 3 months after finishing \\nradiation therapy because the treatment can cause swelling \\nand a hardening or thickening of the lungs called fibrosis. \\nThese side effects are usually temporary. \\n19'),\n",

Because these types of tumors use hormones \\nto fuel their growth, blocking the hormones can help prevent \\nrecurrence and death, either by itself or following adjuvant \\nor neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Hormonal therapy is also \\neffective as a treatment for metastatic breast cancer, shrinking \\nthe cancer and improving cancer-related symptoms. \\n\\x86 Tamoxifen (Nolvadex, Soltamox) \\nTamoxifen blocks estrogen from attaching to breast cancer \\ncells. It is effective at reducing the risk of recurrence in the \\nbreast that had cancer, the risk of developing cancer in the \\nother breast, and the risk of distant recurrence. It is also \\napproved to reduce the risk of breast cancer in women at \\nhigh risk for developing the disease and for reducing local \\nrecurrence for women with DCIS who had a lumpectomy. \\nThe side effects of tamoxifen include hot flashes; vaginal \\ndryness, discharge, or bleeding. Very rare risks include \\na cancer of the lining of the uterus, cataracts, and \\nblood clots. However, tamoxifen improves bone health \\nand cholesterol levels and can be effective for both \\npremenopausal and postmenopausal women. \\n\\x86 Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) \\nDrugs such as anastrozole (Arimidex), exemestane \\n(Aromasin), and letrozole (Femara) decrease the amount \\nof estrogen made by tissues other than the ovaries in \\npostmenopausal women. Research shows that all 3 AI \\ndrugs work equally well and have similar side effects, which \\nmay include muscle and joint stiffness and pain, hot flashes, \\nvaginal dryness, an increased risk of osteoporosis and \\nbroken bones, and higher cholesterol levels. \\nWomen who have not yet gone through menopause \\nshould not take AIs because they do not block the effects \\nof estrogen made by the ovaries. Often, doctors will \\nmonitor blood estrogen levels in women whose periods \\nhave recently stopped, or whose periods stop with \\nchemotherapy, to make sure the ovaries are no longer \\nproducing this hormone. \\n\\x86 Ovarian suppression \\nStopping the ovaries from making estrogen is one of \\nthe oldest hormonal treatments for hormone receptor-\\npositive breast cancer and for premenopausal women with \\nmetastatic breast cancer. Medications called gonadotropin \\nor luteinizing releasing hormone (GnRH or LHRH) \\nanalogues stop the ovaries from making estrogen, causing \\ntemporary menopause. Goserelin (Zoladex) and leuprolide \\n(Lupron) are drugs given by injection under the skin that \\nstop the ovaries from making estrogen for 1 to 3 months. \\nMost commonly, these drugs are given with tamoxifen \\nor AIs as part of adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. Less \\ncommonly, they are given alone. Surgical removal of the \\novaries, called an oophorectomy, may also be considered \\nfor some patients; however, the hormonal effects of this \\nsurgery are permanent. \\n23'),\n",

To make scientific \\nadvances, doctors conduct research studies involving \\nvolunteers, called clinical trials. \\nMany clinical trials focus on new \\ntreatments. Researchers want to \\nlearn if a new treatment is safe, \\neffective, and possibly better than \\nthe treatment doctors use now. \\nThese studies evaluate new drugs, \\ndifferent combinations of existing \\ntreatments, new approaches \\nto radiation therapy or surgery, \\nand new methods of treatment. \\nThere are also clinical trials that \\nstudy new ways to ease symptoms and side effects during \\ntreatment and ways to manage late effects that may occur \\nafter treatment. Clinical trials are often designed to be an \\noption at any point in a patient’s care, starting from the time \\nof diagnosis. \\nPatients who participate in clinical trials can be some of the \\nfirst to get a treatment before it is available to the public. \\nHowever, there are some risks with a clinical trial, including \\npossible side effects and that the new treatment may not \\nwork. People are encouraged to talk with their health care \\nteam about the pros and cons of joining a specific study. \\nPeople decide to participate in clinical trials for many \\nreasons. For some people with breast cancer, a clinical trial \\nis the best treatment option available. Because standard \\ntreatments are not perfect, patients are often willing to \\nface the added uncertainty of a clinical trial in the hope \\nof a better result. Other people volunteer for clinical trials \\nbecause they know these studies are a way to contribute to \\nthe progress in treating breast cancer. Even if they do not \\nbenefit directly from the clinical trial, their participation may \\nhelp other people with breast cancer in the future. \\nInsurance coverage of clinical trials costs differs by location \\nand by study. In some programs, some of the patient’s \\nexpenses from participating in the clinical trial are reimbursed. \\nIn others, they are not. It is important to talk with the research \\nteam and your insurance company first to learn if and how \\nyour treatment in a clinical trial will be covered. \\nSome people worry if they participate in a clinical trial they \\nmay receive no treatment by being given a placebo or a \\n“sugar pill.” Placebos are rarely used in cancer clinical trials. If a \\nplacebo is used, it is usually combined with standard treatment \\nin most cancer clinical trials. When a placebo is used in a \\nstudy, it is done with the full knowledge of the participants. \\nTo join a clinical trial, patients must participate in a process \\nknown as informed consent. During informed consent, the \\nresearch team should: \\n• Describe all of the patient’s options, so that the person \\nunderstands the standard treatment, and how the new \\ntreatment differs from the standard treatment. \\n• List all of the risks of the new treatment, which may or \\nmay not be different from the risks of standard treatment. \\n• Explain what will be required of each patient to \\nparticipate in the clinical trial, including the number of \\ndoctor visits, tests, and the schedule of treatment. \\nTo learn more about clinical trials, \\nvisit www.cancer.net/clinicaltrials. \\n27'),\n",

To make sure the entire tumor is removed, the \\nsurgeon will also remove a small area of healthy tissue \\naround the tumor. Although the goal of surgery is to \\nremove all of the visible cancer, microscopic cells \\nmay be left behind, either in the breast or elsewhere. \\nIn some situations, this means another surgery could \\nbe needed to remove any remaining cancer cells. \\nFor larger invasive cancers, or those that are growing more \\nquickly, doctors may recommend neoadjuvant treatment \\nwith chemotherapy before surgery. Neoadjuvant hormonal \\ntherapy may also be recommended in specific situations. \\nAfter surgery, the next step in managing early-stage invasive \\nbreast cancer is to reduce the risk of recurrence by getting \\nrid of any remaining cancer cells using adjuvant therapies \\nlike radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, \\nand/or hormonal therapy. Whether adjuvant therapy is \\nneeded depends on the likelihood that any cancer cells \\nremain in the breast or the body and the chance that a \\nspecific treatment will work to treat the cancer. Although \\nadjuvant therapy lowers the risk of recurrence, it does not \\ncompletely get rid of this risk. \\nRECURRENT BREAST CANCER \\nIf breast cancer returns after treatment for early-stage \\ndisease, it is called recurrent cancer. Cancer recurs \\nbecause tiny areas of cancer cells are difficult to find and \\nsometimes remain in the body after treatment. Over time, \\nthese cells may multiply and grow large enough to be \\nfound and diagnosed. \\nBreast cancer may come back in the same breast (called \\na local recurrence), in the chest wall or lymph nodes \\nunder the arm (regional recurrence), or in another part \\nof the body, such as the bones, lungs, liver, and brain \\n(distant recurrence). \\nIf a recurrence occurs, the cycle of testing will begin again \\nto learn as much as possible about the recurrence, including \\nwhether the cancer’s stage has changed. A biopsy of the \\nsite is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and to check \\nfor ER, PR, and HER2 status because this may have changed \\nsince the cancer was first diagnosed. \\nThe treatment of recurrent \\nbreast cancer depends on \\nthe previous treatment(s), \\nthe time since the original \\ndiagnosis, the location \\nof the recurrence, and \\nthe characteristics of the \\ntumor, such as ER, PR, and \\nHER2 status. \\nLOCAL OR REGIONAL \\nRECURRENCE \\nFor women who develop a local recurrence within the breast \\nafter having a lumpectomy followed by radiation therapy, the \\nrecommended treatment is a mastectomy. Usually the cancer \\nis completely removed during this surgery. \\nFor women who develop a local or regional recurrence in \\nthe chest wall after having a mastectomy, surgical removal \\nof the recurrent cancer followed by radiation therapy to'),\n",

Some patients live for years after a distant \\nrecurrence of breast cancer. \\nWomen with recurrent breast cancer often experience \\nemotions such as disbelief or fear. Patients are encouraged \\nto talk with their health care team about these feelings and \\nask about support services to help them cope. \\nMETASTATIC BREAST CANCER \\nIf breast cancer has spread to another location in the body, \\nor come back in another location, it is called metastatic \\ncancer. People with this diagnosis are encouraged to talk \\nwith doctors who are experienced in treating this stage \\nof cancer because there can be different opinions about \\nthe best treatment plan. You may want to seek a second \\nopinion before starting treatment so you are comfortable \\nwith your treatment plan. \\nThe primary goals of treatment for metastatic breast cancer \\nare to extend or prolong life and to relieve the symptoms \\ncaused by the cancer. Your health care team may \\nrecommend a treatment plan that combines chemotherapy, \\ntargeted therapy, radiation therapy, and/or hormonal \\ntherapy to shrink the cancer. Because it is not unusual for \\nmetastatic breast cancer to stop responding to various \\ndrug combinations, you may need to change therapies \\nfairly often. Palliative care will also be important to help \\nrelieve symptoms and side effects. \\nFor most patients, a diagnosis of metastatic cancer is very \\nstressful and, at times, difficult to bear. Patients and their \\nfamilies are encouraged to talk about the way they are feeling \\nwith doctors, nurses, social workers, or other members of \\nthe health care team. It may also be helpful to talk with other \\npatients, potentially through a support group. \\nVisit Cancer.Net to learn more about breast cancer \\n(www.cancer.net/breast) and metastatic breast \\ncancer (www.cancer.net/metastaticbreast). \\n31'),\n",

Cancer and its treatment often cause a persistent feeling of physical, \\nemotional, or mental tiredness or exhaustion. Most people receiving cancer \\ntreatment experience some type of fatigue, which can make even a small effort, \\nsuch as walking across a room, seem like too much. Fatigue can seriously \\naffect all aspects of a person’s life, from relationships with friends and family \\nto the ability to perform at work.

Pain can be caused by the tumor, be a side effect of cancer treatment, \\nor result from causes not related to the cancer. Untreated pain can make other \\naspects of cancer seem worse, such as fatigue, weakness, nausea, constipation, \\nsleep disturbances, depression, anxiety, and mental confusion. However, it is \\nimportant to know that up to 95% of cancer pain can be treated successfully \\nusing medication or other strategies.

Lymphedema is the abnormal buildup of \\nfluid in soft tissue, typically in an arm, caused by a blockage \\nin the lymphatic system. It can happen immediately after \\nsurgery or radiation therapy, or months or years after \\ncancer treatment has ended. In some cases, the swelling \\ngoes away on its own as the body heals and normal lymph \\nfluid flow resumes. However, lymphedema may become \\nchronic when the lymphatic system changes and can no \\nlonger meet the body’s demands for fluid drainage. There \\nis no cure for chronic lymphedema; however, there are \\nways to keep it from getting worse. Talk with a member of \\nyour health care team about the best way to prevent and \\nmanage lymphedema. \\nInfertility. Some treatments for breast cancer may cause \\ntemporary or permanent infertility, which is the inability to \\nbecome pregnant or have children. If this is a concern for \\nyou, talk with your doctor before treatment begins about \\nthe possible fertility-related side effects of your treatment \\nplan and the options for preserving your fertility. \\nNausea and vomiting. \\nNausea and vomiting are \\ncommon side effects of \\nmany cancer treatments. \\nNausea is feeling the urge \\nto vomit or throw up. \\nVomiting may happen \\nbefore treatment as a \\nresult of anxiety, within 24 \\nhours after treatment, or 2 \\nor more days after treatment. Mild nausea and vomiting can \\nbe uncomfortable, but they usually do not cause serious \\nproblems. Severe vomiting, on the other hand, can cause \\ndehydration, electrolyte imbalances (loss of minerals from \\nthe body, such as potassium and sodium), weight loss, and \\ndepression. In addition to medications that help prevent \\nnausea and vomiting, many people find that behavioral \\ntreatments help control these side effects. Talk with your \\nhealth care team about ways to change the expectation and \\nfear of nausea and vomiting. \\nHair loss. Many chemotherapy drugs can cause partial or \\ncomplete hair loss. Hair may fall out entirely, gradually, or \\nin sections. In some cases, hair may simply become thin, \\nduller, or dryer. Hair loss is most noticeable on the scalp, \\nbut it may affect other parts of the body, such as the face \\n(eyebrows and eyelashes), arms, legs, underarms, and pubic \\narea. Hair loss is usually temporary, and in most cases, hair \\nwill grow back after treatment has finished. \\nChemobrain. Cancer survivors commonly use the term \\n“chemobrain” to describe difficulties thinking clearly after \\ncancer treatment. This also can occur in patients who did not \\nreceive chemotherapy as part of breast cancer treatment. \\nCognitive side effects vary and sometimes make it hard to \\ncomplete daily activities. People who experience severe \\nproblems concentrating, multitasking, or understanding or \\nremembering things should talk with their doctor or another \\nmember of the health care team to learn about medication, \\ncognitive rehabilitation and training, and other ways to \\nmanage these challenges. \\nEmotional and social effects \\nFor many people, the diagnosis and treatment of breast \\ncancer is stressful and can trigger difficult emotions. \\nPhysical changes that occur during treatment, such \\nas having a breast removed, hair loss, weight gain or \\nweight loss, or scars from surgery, may make you feel \\nuncomfortable and self-conscious.

Also called \\ninternal radiation therapy. \\nBRCA1 / BRCA2: Breast cancer genes that can increase a \\nperson’s risk of developing breast cancer and other cancers \\nif they contain genetic changes (mutations). \\nCarcinoma: Cancer that starts in skin or tissues that line the \\ninside or cover the outside of internal organs. \\nCells: The basic units that make up the human body. \\nChemotherapy: The use of drugs to destroy cancer cells. \\nClinical trial: A research study that involves volunteers. \\nMany clinical trials test new treatments and/or prevention \\nmethods to find out whether they are safe, effective, and \\npossibly better than the current standard of care (the best \\nknown treatment). \\nCure: To fully restore health. This term is sometimes used \\nwhen a person’s cancer has not returned for at least 5 \\nyears after treatment. However, the concept of “cure” is \\ndifficult to apply to breast cancer because undetected \\ncancer cells can sometimes remain in the body after \\ntreatment, causing the cancer to return later. Recurrence \\nafter 5 years is still possible. \\nDuct: Tube-like structures in the breast that connect the \\nglands, lobules, and lobes and carry milk from the lobe to \\nthe nipple. \\nEarly-stage breast cancer:  Breast cancer that is \\ndetermined to be stage I to stage IIA. \\nExternal-beam radiation therapy:  Radiation therapy given \\nfrom a machine located outside the body. \\nExternal breast prosthesis:  An artificial breast form made \\nout of silicone gel, foam, fiberfill, or another material that \\nhas a similar weight and feel to natural breast tissue and \\ncan be worn after a mastectomy to re-create a natural \\nappearance without surgery.'),\n",

In some cases, breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will also be performed. If a tumour is \\nfound, a biopsy will be taken to assess the cancer before any treatment is planned.\\nTreatment options for breast cancer\\n• The treatment of breast cancer depends on how far advanced the cancer is (Stage 0 IV) and what type of \\ncancer is present. \\n• Surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy and targeted therapy are used in the \\ntreatment of breast cancer.\\n• Breast cancer is ‘staged’ according to tumour  size, involvement of lymph nodes and whether it has spread \\noutside the breast and lymph nodes  to other parts of the body, according to the TNM system (T – tumour , \\nN – nodes, M – metastases). This information is used to help decide the best treatment.\\n• The presence of biomarkers  including hormone receptors and a receptor called HER2  also help to \\ndetermine what type of therapy is given. \\nEarly stage non-invasive breast cancer Biological testing of the tumour\\n• Patients with Stage 0 disease will usually have the tumour removed by breast-conserving surgery  or \\nmastectomy. Radiotherapy is given after breast-conserving surgery but is not usually needed after \\nmastectomy. Most patients with oestrogen receptor (ER)  positive cancer will be given endocrine \\ntherapy after surgery and radiotherapy . Endocrine therapy is given to decrease the risk of recurrence \\n(the cancer coming back), as well as prevention of new cancers in both the remaining and contralateral breast.'),\n",

Some of these factors can be determined \\nfrom a biopsy, but others may only be determined after surgery has taken place to remove the tumour . \\nHistology\\nThe histology of a breast cancer tells us which tissues of the breast the cancer has formed in (ductal or lobular \\ncarcinomas) and whether it is invasive  or non-invasive. Histology can also reveal some of the rarer subtypes \\nof breast cancer, including the following:\\n• Tubular breast cancers are usually small and are made up of tube-shaped structures called ‘tubules’. These \\ntumours are usually low- grade, meaning that their cells look similar to normal, healthy cells and tend to \\ngrow slowly.\\n• Mucinous breast tumours  are made up of abnormal cells that float in pools of mucin (the main ingredient of \\nmucus). These tumours usually respond well to treatment.\\n• Medullary breast tumours  are soft, fleshy masses which tend to grow slowly and don’t usually spread \\noutside the breast.\\n• Papillary breast tumours  are made up of small, finger-like projections. These tumours  are usually \\nmoderate- grade, meaning that their cells don’t look like normal cells and are growing and dividing a little \\nfaster than normal.\\nGrade\\nGrade is based on how different tumour  cells look from normal breast cells, and on how quickly they grow. \\nThe grade will be a value between one and three and reflects the aggressiveness of tumour  cells; the higher the \\ngrade, the more aggressive the tumour . \\nHormone receptor status and HER2 gene expression\\nOestrogen and progesterone are sex hormones that are naturally present in women. Some breast tumours  \\ndepend on a supply of oestrogen  and/or progesterone to grow; these types of tumour  have a high number of \\nreceptors ( ER or PgR) that the hormones attach to in order to stimulate growth of the tumour . Tumours with \\nexpression of ER  are called ER positive tumours and can be treated by reducing the supply of oestrogen  to \\nthe tumour, typically by blocking the ER or limiting the levels of oestrogen  in the blood. \\nHER2 receptors are expressed on the surface of all cells and are involved in the normal processes of cell growth, \\nmultiplication and repair. About 20% of breast cancers have abnormally high levels of HER2  on the surface of \\nthe tumour cells and are therefore called HER2  positive tumours. These tumours tend to grow faster and are \\nmore likely to spread compared with HER2  negative breast cancers. HER2  positive breast cancer can be treated \\nwith drugs that block HER2  receptors to stop the uncontrolled growth of the tumour .'),\n",

The choice and \\ncombination of treatments will be discussed with you and your preferences will be taken into account. \\nOne of the most important decisions you will have to make is where to be treated. Treatment within a \\nmultidisciplinary and specialised team improves survival and quality of life, as opposed to being treated by a \\nsingle doctor. All of your treatment decisions should be taken after discussion in a multidisciplinary meeting, \\nwhere doctors from different specialties, nurses and other health professionals involved in your care will discuss \\nyour case and decide which treatment is the best option for you.\\nSurgery\\nThe two types of surgery for breast cancer are breast-\\nconserving surgery , in which the surgical team \\nremoves the tumour but tries to keep as much of the \\nbreast as possible, or mastectomy, in which the whole \\nbreast is removed. If the lymph nodes in your armpit \\nlook like they are clear of cancer in imaging tests, \\nthen a technique called sentinel lymph node biopsy \\nshould be performed. This identifies the most important \\n(sentinel) lymph node and examines it; if no cancer is \\ndetected, then no other lymph nodes  will be removed, \\nbut if cancer is found in that lymph node, more nodes \\nmay have to be removed (called axillary dissection). Patients undergoing mastectomy  should usually be offered \\nimmediate or delayed breast reconstruction, except in the case of inflammatory breast cancer.\\nRadiotherapy\\nRadiotherapy is a type of treatment that uses ionising radiation , which damages the DNA of cancerous cells, \\ncausing the cells to die. Radiotherapy  is usually given after breast-conserving surgery and may also be \\ngiven after mastectomy. Radiotherapy may also be given to patients with locally-advanced disease which \\nremains inoperable after systemic  treatment and may be considered in certain patients with metastatic disease \\nto treat the symptoms of the primary tumour  or distant metastases and improve quality of life. \\nRadiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery is usually given as whole breast radiotherapy (WBRT). In \\npatients considered to be at high risk of recurrence who have already undergone WBRT , a radiotherapy ‘boost’ \\nmay be given – this is an extra, lower dose of radiation directed specifically to the area that the tumour  was \\nremoved from. This may be done similarly to WBRT  with external radiotherapy  or with brachytherapy, in which \\na radiation source is placed into the breast tissue for a short time to provide internal radiotherapy  focused only \\non a small margin of tissue surrounding the site of surgery.'),\n",

This \\ntreatment is shorter than WBRT and reduces the exposure of healthy breast tissue and other organs in the chest \\n(e.g. heart, lungs) to radiation, reducing the risk of long-term side effects. \\nSome patients also require radiotherapy  after mastectomy, because of the presence of factors that increase \\nthe risk of the cancer coming back. This is done similarly to radiotherapy  after breast-conserving surgery.\\nSystemic therapy\\nThere are several types of systemic  therapy that you may be treated with, depending on the type and stage of \\ncancer you have.\\nChemotherapy\\nChemotherapy destroys cancer cells and is used to treat most triple negative, HER2 positive and luminal B-like \\nbreast cancers. Chemotherapy  is usually given every 1–3 weeks as intravenous  infusions. Some patients may \\nalso be offered additional oral chemotherapy  following completion of standard intravenous chemotherapy .\\nEndocrine therapies\\nEndocrine therapies aim to reduce the effects of oestrogen in ER positive breast cancers. This is the most \\nimportant type of systemic  treatment for ER positive tumours, also called hormone-dependent tumours . \\nThere are a number of types of endocrine therapy  available, which are taken orally or administered as an \\ninjection: \\n• Selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) block ER  on breast cells to prevent oestrogen  \\nattaching to the receptors. Tamoxifen  is a type of SERM.\\n• Selective oestrogen receptor downregulators (SERDs), such as fulvestrant , work in a similar way to \\nSERMs, but also reduce the number of ER s. \\n• Ovarian function suppression by gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues or by surgery may \\nbe offered to pre- and perimenopausal women to reduce the supply of oestrogen  from the ovaries to the \\ntumour.\\n• Aromatase inhibitors reduce the production of oestrogen in tissues and organs other than the ovaries, \\nand is therefore effective only in postmenopausal women, unless the function of the ovaries is suppressed \\n(oestrogen levels are artificially lowered) in premenopausal women. Anastrozole , letrozole and \\nexemestane are all aromatase inhibitors.'),\n",

Occasionally, ER-positive patients \\nmay require chemotherapy because the cancer is particularly aggressive.

However, this is a delicate decision that must be taken by the \\nwoman and her partner, after being well informed of all available options. Several types of treatment are possible \\nduring pregnancy, depending on the trimester (Peccatori et al. 2013). Surgery is usually safe in any trimester. \\nChemotherapy is safe during the second and third trimesters; anthracycline -based chemotherapy is usually \\nthe first choice of treatment in pregnancy and taxanes  may also be used. Endocrine and anti- HER2 therapies \\ncan only be given after the baby is born. Radiotherapy  is usually postponed until after the baby is born. The \\nmost important factor for the baby is to avoid premature birth.\\nYoung women\\nIn younger, premenopausal patients, treatment for breast cancer can reduce fertility and can cause an early or \\ntemporary menopause. Before starting treatment, your doctor will discuss all possible fertility issues with you \\nand will give you information about any suitable fertility-preservation options available to you  (Peccatori et al. 2013, \\nCardoso et al. 2018).'),\n",

If you are frail, it may be necessary to adjust \\nstandard treatments to balance the benefits of the treatment against the risks for you. \\nMen\\nAlmost all cases of breast cancer in men are hormone \\nreceptor-positive for both oestrogen  and androgen \\nhormone receptors.

Tamoxifen is the standard adjuvant endocrine therapy (Cardoso et al. 2018). For male metastatic breast \\ncancer, endocrine therapy with tamoxifen is standard, but an aromatase inhibitor in combination with \\ngonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues or surgical removal of the testicles to reduce androgen  levels \\n(orchiectomy), may also be considered (Cardoso et al. 2018).

The treatment that you will be offered depends on the extent of \\nthe recurrence and the previous treatment(s) you have received. When the tumour  comes back as a recurrence \\nin the breast or surrounding lymph nodes , you may be offered further surgery followed by radiotherapy  and/or \\nsystemic therapy. Recurrent tumours  in distant organs are regarded as metastatic cancers and you can usually \\nhave further systemic  therapy – this may include different drugs to those you were treated with when you were \\nfirst diagnosed, although some patients may receive the same treatments again, especially if they have been free \\nfrom breast cancer for an extended period of time.'),\n",

It is important to take good care \\nof yourself and get the support that you need to \\nresume your normal life, including family activities \\nand work or professional roles.\\nEating a healthy diet and keeping active can help \\nimprove your overall health, fitness and mood. \\nExercising and maintaining your body weight in a healthy range may also reduce your risk of recurrence (Cardoso \\net al. 2018 [in press]).

These long-term effects can be managed so it is \\nimportant that you tell your doctor or specialist nurse  about any persistent or new symptoms. \\nNotably, treatments for breast cancer can cause an early menopause  along with all \\nof the symptoms that are associated with the change in hormone levels, including \\nhot flushes, increased sweating, vaginal dryness and a loss of interest in sex. The \\nmenopause can also contribute to osteoporosis . If you have concerns about early \\nmenopause then you should talk to your doctor or specialist nurse . Hormone \\nreplacement therapy is not normally recommended after breast cancer as it is \\nthought that it could increase the chances of the cancer coming back.\\nFor further information and advice regarding how to regain your life as far as possible \\nafter treatment for cancer, see ESMO’s patient guide on survivorship (ESMO 2017) \\n(http://www.esmo.org/Patients/Patient-Guides/Patient-Guide-on-Survivorship). \\nWhat does \\nsurvivorship mean?\\nLet us explain \\nit to you.\\nesmo.org\\nESMO Patient Guide Series\\nbased on the ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines\\nSurvivorship\\nIn collaboration with'),\n",

Invasive \\nbreast cancer is also called early-\\nstage breast cancer. \\nWhat is invasive breast \\ncancer?\\nBreast cancer starts in the cells of the breast. \\nOver time, these cells form a mass called a \\ntumor. In invasive breast cancer, cancer has \\ngrown outside the milk ducts or milk glands \\n(lobules) into the surrounding breast tissue. \\nOnce outside the ducts or lobules, breast \\ncancer can spread through lymph or blood to \\nlymph nodes or other parts of the body.\\nAlmost all invasive breast cancers are \\ncarcinomas—cancers that start in the cells that \\nline the inner or outer surfaces of the body. \\nThere are different types of breast carcinoma, \\nmost of which arise in cells that make up the \\nlining (epithelial cells) in the terminal duct \\nlobular units (TDLUs) of the breast. A TDLU \\nconsists of a lobule connected to the end of \\na small milk duct. The most common types of \\ninvasive breast cancer are ductal carcinoma \\nand lobular carcinoma.\\nAnyone can develop breast cancer, including \\nthose assigned male at birth. Although there \\nare some differences between breast cancers \\nin those assigned male and those assigned \\nfemale at birth, treatment is very similar for all \\ngenders.\\nThe breast\\nThe breast is a glandular \\norgan made up of milk \\nducts, fat, nerves, blood \\nand lymph vessels, \\nligaments, and other \\nconnective tissue.'),\n",

Behind the breast are the \\npectoral (chest) muscle and ribs. Muscle and \\nligaments help hold the breast in place.\\nBreast tissue contains glands that can make \\nmilk. These milk glands are called lobules. \\nLobules look like tiny clusters of grapes. Small \\ntubes called ducts connect the lobules to the \\nnipple.\\nThe ring of darker breast skin in the center \\nof the breast is called the areola. The raised \\ntip within the areola is called the nipple. The \\nnipple-areola complex (NAC) is a term that \\nrefers to both parts. \\nLymphatic fluid (lymph) drains from breast \\ntissue into lymph vessels and travels to lymph \\nnodes near your armpit (axilla).

A pathologist will \\nexamine the biopsy for cancer and write a \\nreport called a pathology report. Ask questions \\nabout your biopsy results and what it means \\nfor your treatment.\\nThere are different types of biopsies. Some \\nbiopsies are guided using imaging, such as \\nultrasound or MRI. The primary or main tumor \\nis biopsied first. Other tumors or tumors in \\ndifferent areas may also be biopsied. You may \\nhave tissue removed from the breast, lymph \\nnodes, or both.\\nTypes of possible biopsies include:\\n \\x86 Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or \\ncore biopsy (CB) uses needles of \\ndifferent sizes to remove a sample of \\ntissue or fluid. In a vacuum-assisted \\ncore biopsy (VACB), suction from a \\nspecial vacuum device is used to remove \\nthe sample through a needle.\\n \\x86 Incisional biopsy removes a small \\namount of tissue through a cut in the skin \\nor body.\\n \\x86 Excisional biopsy removes the entire \\nabnormal area. This is not the preferred \\ntype of biopsy, but may be necessary \\nif other methods are not possible or \\nwhen the biopsy results don’t match the \\nexpected findings. An excisional biopsy \\nis usually done under anesthesia by a \\nsurgeon in an operating room.\\nBefore biopsies are performed, usually the \\narea is injected with numbing medicine. A core \\nneedle biopsy (CNB) removes more than one \\ntissue sample, but usually through the same \\narea on the breast. The samples are small. \\nThe needle is often guided into the tumor with \\nimaging. When mammography is used during a \\nbiopsy, it is called a stereotactic needle biopsy.\\nOne or more clips may be placed near the \\nbreast tumor during a biopsy. The clips are \\nsmall, painless, and made of metal. They will \\nmark the site for possible future treatment \\nand imaging. The clips will stay in place until \\nsurgery. If the area biopsied is benign, the clip \\nwill remain in place to mark the biopsy site on \\nfuture imaging. The clips cause no problems, \\neven if they are left in place for a long time. You \\nwill be able to go through airport security and \\nhave an MRI.\\nAxillary lymph node needle biopsy\\nAn axillary lymph node (ALN) drains lymph \\nfluid from the breast and nearby areas.

To do so, the tumor is \\nremoved along with a rim of normal-looking \\ntissue around its edge called the surgical \\nmargin. The surgical margin may look normal \\nduring surgery, but cancerous cells may be \\nfound when viewed under a microscope by a \\npathologist. A clear or negative margin (R0) is \\nwhen no cancer cells are found in the tissue \\naround the edge of the tumor. In a positive \\nmargin, cancer cells are found in normal-\\nlooking tissue around the tumor. \\nAfter surgery, you may receive treatment such \\nas radiation to kill any remaining cancer cells. \\nYou might have a wound drain to prevent \\nfluid from collecting in the body after surgery. \\nThese drains are usually removed a few days \\nafter surgery.\\nLumpectomy\\nLumpectomy is the removal of abnormal cells \\nor a tumor.

For \\nsome, it may be taken with fulvestrant or \\ntamoxifen.\\nImmunotherapy\\nImmunotherapy is a type of systemic treatment \\nthat tries to reactivate the immune system \\nagainst tumor cells. The immune system \\nhas many on and off switches. Tumors take \\nadvantage of off switches. Immunotherapy can \\nblock off switches, which helps the immune \\nsystem turn on. Immunotherapy can be \\ngiven alone or with other types of treatment. \\nPembrolizumab (Keytruda) is an example of \\nimmunotherapy.\\nEndocrine therapy \\nEndocrine therapy blocks estrogen or \\nprogesterone to treat hormone receptor-\\npositive (HR+) breast cancer. The endocrine \\nsystem is made up of organs and tissues that \\nproduce hormones. Hormones are natural \\nchemicals released into the bloodstream. \\nThere are 4 hormones that might be targeted \\nin endocrine therapy: \\n \\x86 Estrogen is made mainly by the ovaries, \\nbut is also made by other tissues in the \\nbody such as fat tissue.\\n \\x86 Progesterone is made mainly by the \\novaries.\\n \\x86 Luteinizing hormone-releasing \\nhormone (LHRH) is made by a part \\nof the brain called the hypothalamus. It \\ntells the ovaries to make estrogen and \\nprogesterone and testicles to make \\ntestosterone. LHRH is also called \\ngonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). \\n \\x86 Androgen is made by the adrenal \\nglands, testicles, and ovaries.\\nHormones may cause breast cancer to \\ngrow. Endocrine therapy will stop your body \\nfrom making hormones or it will block what \\nhormones do in the body. This can slow tumor \\ngrowth or shrink the tumor for a period of time. \\nEndocrine therapy is sometimes called \\nhormone therapy or anti-estrogen. It is not the \\nsame as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) \\nused for menopause. \\nThose who want to have children in the future \\nshould discuss fertility plans with their doctor'),\n",

You might consider \\nspeaking with a plastic surgeon \\nbefore surgery. This chapter offers \\nmore information on flat closure \\nand breast reconstruction.\\nThe recovery time for each procedure differs. \\nThis can affect your ability to return to work \\nor participate in activities. You might consider \\nspeaking with a plastic surgeon before surgery \\nto discuss your options and what to expect. \\nA plastic surgeon performs oncoplastic \\n(breast cancer surgery) reductions, balancing \\nprocedures, and breast reconstruction.\\nVolume displacement\\nWith a lumpectomy, most people have a \\nscar with some volume loss. However, if you \\nneed a large lumpectomy and your surgeon \\nthinks your breast will look more abnormal \\nafterwards, your breast may be able to be re-\\nshaped at the time of surgery. This procedure \\nis called volume displacement or oncoplasty. \\nOnly a limited number of cancer centers \\nperform this procedure. It is often done by the \\ncancer surgeon or plastic surgeon right after \\nthe lumpectomy. The surgeon will shift the \\nremaining breast tissue to fill the space left by \\nthe removed tumor.\\nIf volume displacement is planned, a larger \\npiece of your breast will need to be removed. \\nDespite a larger piece being removed, the \\nnatural look of your breast will be kept. \\nHowever, with large amounts of tissue \\nremoved, your breast may be smaller than \\nbefore.\\nYou may not like the results of the volume \\ndisplacement. In this case, breast revision \\nsurgery may help. This surgery is done \\nby a plastic surgeon. A second volume \\ndisplacement may be an option, too. Another \\noption is to get breast implants or mastectomy \\nwith reconstruction.\\nFlat closure\\nIn a total mastectomy with a flat closure, the \\nentire breast, including nipple, extra skin, \\nfat, and other tissue in the breast area, is \\nremoved. The remaining skin is tightened \\nand sewn together. No breast mound is \\ncreated, and no implant is added. The scar \\nwill be slightly raised and differ in color than \\nthe surrounding skin. A flat closure is not \\ncompletely flat or smooth. The result varies \\nfrom person to person. Ask to look at pictures \\nfrom flat closures so you know what to expect. \\nYou might decide to have a flat closure \\nprocedure later or after having breast implants \\nremoved. Talk to your care team to learn more.'),\n",

In many cases, breast \\nreconstruction involves a staged approach. It \\nmight require more than one procedure.\\nYou may have a choice as to when \\nbreast reconstruction is done. Immediate \\nreconstruction is finished within hours after \\nremoving the breast. Delayed reconstruction \\ncan occur months or years after the cancer \\nsurgery. Reconstruction can also be done in \\nstages, with part of the reconstruction done \\nat the time of the original cancer surgery and \\nfinished with another surgery later. A plastic \\nsurgeon performs breast reconstruction. \\nBreasts can be reconstructed with implants \\nand flaps. All methods are generally safe, \\nbut as with any surgery, there are risks. Ask \\nyour treatment team for a complete list of side \\neffects.\\nImplants\\nBreast implants are small bags filled with salt \\nwater, silicone gel, or both. They are placed \\nunder the breast skin or muscle to look like a \\nnew breast following a mastectomy. A balloon-\\nlike device, called an expander, may be used \\nfirst to stretch out tissue. It will be placed under \\nyour skin or muscle and enlarged every few \\nweeks for 2 to 3 months. When your skin is \\nstretched to the proper size, you will have \\nsurgery to place the final implant.\\nImplants have a small risk of leaking or \\ncausing other issues. You may feel pain from \\nthe implant or expander. Scar tissue or tissue \\ndeath can occur. \\nFlaps\\nBreasts can be remade using tissue from other \\nparts of your body, known as flaps. These flaps \\nare taken from the abdomen, buttocks, thigh, \\nor from under the shoulder blade. Some flaps \\nare completely removed and then sewn in \\nplace. Other flaps stay attached to your body \\nbut are slid over and sewn into place.\\nThere are several risks associated with flaps, \\nincluding death of fat in the flap, which can \\ncause lumps. A hernia may result from muscle \\nweakness. Problems are more likely to occur \\namong those who have diabetes or who \\nsmoke.\\nImplants and flaps\\nSome breasts are reconstructed with both \\nimplants and flaps. This method may give the \\nreconstructed breast more volume to match \\nthe other breast. For any reconstruction, you \\nmay need surgery on your remaining breast to \\nmatch the size and shape of both breasts.\\nNipple replacement\\nLike your breast, a nipple can be remade. To \\nrebuild a nipple, a plastic surgeon can use \\nsurrounding tissues. Also, nipples can be \\nremade with tissue from the thigh or the other \\nnipple. Tissue can be darkened with a tattoo to \\nlook more like a nipple. It is important to note \\nthat while you can remake something to look \\nlike a nipple, it will not have the sensation of \\nyour real nipple. Also, a tattoo can be done to \\nlook like a nipple without having to take tissue \\nfrom another part of the body.'),\n",

Breast reconstruction should be \\na shared decision between you and your \\ncare team. Make your wishes known.\\n \\x86 Health issues – You may have health \\nissues such as diabetes or a blood \\ndisorder that might affect or delay healing, \\nor make longer procedures unsafe.\\n \\x86 Tobacco use – Smoking delays wound \\nhealing and can cause mastectomy flap \\ndeath (necrosis), nipple-areola complex \\n(NAC) necrosis in a nipple-sparing \\nmastectomy, infection, and failure of \\nimplant-based reconstruction. In free flap \\nreconstruction, smoking increases the risk \\nof complications. You are encouraged to \\nstop smoking prior to reconstruction.\\n \\x86 Breast size and shape – There are \\nlimits to the available sizes of breast \\nimplants. Very large breasts or breasts \\nthat lack tone or droop (called ptosis) \\nmight be difficult to match. Breast \\nreduction surgery might be an option.\\n \\x86 Body mass index (BMI) – Those with \\nan elevated BMI have an increased risk of \\ninfections and complications with breast \\nreconstruction. \\nIf you smoke or vape,          \\nseek help to quit\\nSmoking or vaping nicotine greatly \\nincreases your chances of having side \\neffects during and after surgery. Smoking \\nand vaping can limit how well cancer \\ntreatment works and prevent wound \\nhealing. They also increase your chances \\nof developing other cancers. Cannabis use \\nmight also affect the amount of anesthesia \\nused during surgery. \\nNicotine is the chemical in tobacco that \\nmakes you want to keep smoking and \\nvaping. Nicotine withdrawal is challenging \\nfor most people who smoke or vape. The \\nstress of having cancer may make it even \\nharder to quit. If you smoke or vape, ask \\nyour care team about counseling and \\nmedicines to help you quit.\\nMore information can be found in the NCCN \\nGuidelines for Patients: Quitting Smoking \\nat NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the \\nNCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.\\nFor online support, try these websites:\\n• SmokeFree.gov\\n• CDC.gov/tobacco'),\n",

However, \\nabsorbing the news of a cancer diagnosis is a \\nkey part of the coping process. \\nIn the weeks to come, you may find it helpful \\nto have family members or friends come to \\nyour appointments with you. They will not only \\ngive you some much-needed support, but \\nthey can also help listen to and remember the \\ninformation given by your health care team. \\nUsing this ASCO Answers guide may also be \\nhelpful. This booklet was designed to explain some of the medical terms doctors may use when talking about your cancer \\nand help you keep track of the specifics of your breast cancer diagnosis and treatment plan. Throughout this guide, you will \\nfind questions to ask your doctor, nurse, or another member of your health care team, as well as plenty of space to write \\ndown their answers or other important information. There are also check boxes you can use to identify the tests, procedures, \\nand treatments that will make up your cancer care plan. \\nHowever you choose to keep track of this information, it is important to do so. Getting the facts about your diagnosis will \\nhelp you make the best decisions based on your situation in the coming days. Additionally, being an informed, involved \\npatient and voicing your questions and concerns will help you and your health care team form a partnership in your care. \\nTell your doctor and nurse how you prefer to receive information and how much you want to know about your diagnosis, \\ntreatment, and prognosis, which is the chance of recovery.

Within this tissue is \\na network of lobes, which are made up of small, tube-like structures called lobules that contain milk glands. Tiny ducts \\nconnect the glands, lobules, and lobes, carrying the milk from the lobes to the nipple. The nipple is located in the middle of \\nthe areola, which is the darker area that surrounds the nipple. Blood and lymph vessels also run throughout the breast. Blood \\nnourishes the cells, and the lymphatic system drains bodily waste products. The lymph vessels connect to lymph nodes, \\nwhich are tiny, bean-shaped organs that help fight infection. \\nBreast cancer \\nis the most \\ncommon \\ncancer in \\nwomen \\n(excluding \\nskin cancer), \\nbut men \\ncan also be \\ndiagnosed\\n. \\nBreast cancer development\\n \\nBreast cancer begins when healthy cells \\nin the breast change and grow out of \\ncontrol, forming a mass called a tumor. \\nA tumor can be cancerous or benign. A \\ncancerous tumor is malignant, meaning \\nit can spread to other parts of the body. \\nA benign tumor can grow but does not \\nspread to other parts of the body, and it \\nis rarely life-threatening. \\nTypes of breast cancer \\nBreast cancer can be invasive or noninvasive. Invasive breast cancer is cancer that \\nspreads into surrounding tissues. Noninvasive breast cancer does not go beyond \\nthe milk ducts or lobules in the\\xa0breast. Most breast cancers start in the ducts, \\ncalled ductal carcinoma, or in the lobules, called lobular carcinoma. A pathologist \\ndetermines whether a tumor removed during a biopsy is ductal or lobular cancer. \\nA pathologist is a doctor who specializes in interpreting laboratory tests and \\nevaluating cells, tissues, and organs to diagnose disease. \\nIf the disease has spread outside the duct or lobule and into the surrounding \\ntissue, it is called invasive or infiltrating ductal or lobular carcinoma. Cancer that \\nis located only in the duct or lobule is called in situ, meaning “in place,” and \\nis noninvasive. Most in situ breast cancers are ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). \\nDCIS is often treated with surgery, radiation therapy, and hormonal therapy \\n(see “Breast Cancer Treatment,” p. 14). Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is not'),\n",

To reduce this risk, LCIS is \\nsometimes treated with hormonal therapy. \\nOther less common types of breast cancer include medullary, \\nmucinous, tubular, metaplastic, and papillary breast cancer, as \\nwell as other even rarer types. Inflammatory breast cancer is a \\nfaster growing type of cancer that accounts for about 1% to 5% \\nof all breast cancers. At first it may be misdiagnosed as a breast \\ninfection because there is often swelling of the breast and \\nredness of the breast skin that starts suddenly, and there may \\nbe no breast mass or lump. Paget’s disease is a type of cancer \\nthat begins in the ducts of the nipple. The skin often appears \\nscaly and may be itchy. Although it is usually in situ, it can also \\nbe an invasive cancer. \\nBreast cancer spread \\nAs a cancerous breast tumor grows, cancer cells may break \\naway and be carried to other parts of the body through \\nthe bloodstream or lymphatic system. During this process, \\nknown as metastasis, the cancer cells can grow and develop \\nin new locations in the body. One of the first places breast \\ncancer usually spreads is to the regional lymph nodes \\nlocated under the arm, in the neck, under the chest bone, or \\njust above the collarbone. \\nBreast cancer can also spread farther away from the breast \\nto other parts of the body, such as the bones, lungs, and \\nliver. Less often, breast cancer may spread to the brain. Breast \\ncancer that has spread to a distant location in the body is \\nreferred to as stage IV or metastatic breast cancer. However, \\neven if the cancer has spread, it is still named for the area \\nwhere it began. For example, if breast cancer spreads to the \\n5'),\n",

No \\nmatter whether the cancer has spread or how far it has spread, \\nbreast cancer can be treated and/or managed. \\nBreast cancer genetics \\nAlthough most women who develop breast cancer have \\nno known risk factors and no family history of breast \\ncancer, about 5% to 10% of breast cancers occur when gene \\nchanges, called mutations, are passed down in a family \\nfrom one generation to the next. Breast cancer may run in \\na family if other close relatives have been diagnosed with \\nbreast, ovarian, or other cancers, especially before age 50. \\nIf 2 first-degree relatives developed breast cancer, the risk \\nis 5 times the average risk. \\nThere are several genes linked to an increased risk of \\nbreast cancer, but 2 of the most common are breast \\ncancer genes 1 and 2. These are commonly shortened to \\nBRCA1 or BRCA2. A mutation in either of these genes gives \\na woman an increased risk of developing breast and/or \\novarian cancer, as well as other types of cancer. Men who \\ninherit these gene mutations also have an increased risk of \\ndeveloping breast cancer, as well as prostate cancer. \\nOther gene mutations or hereditary conditions can increase \\na person’s risk of breast cancer. They are far less common \\nthan BRCA1 or BRCA2,  and they do not increase the risk of \\nbreast cancer as much: \\n• Lynch syndrome, associated with the MLH1 and \\nMSH2 genes \\nNOTES: \\n• Cowden syndrome (CS), associated with the PTEN  gene \\n• Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), associated with the TP53 \\nand CHEK2 genes \\n• Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), associated with the \\nSTK11 gene \\n• Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T), associated with the ATM  gene \\n• Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, associated with the \\nCDH1 gene \\n• PALB2 gene \\nGenetic testing is available to check for known mutations \\nin these genes. Your doctor may recommend a test called \\na panel test, which looks for mutations in several different \\ngenes at the same time. But this testing is not recommended \\nfor everyone. It is only recommended after a person has \\nreceived appropriate genetic counseling. \\nQUESTIONS TO ASK THE HEALTH CARE TEAM \\n• Who will be part of my health care team, and what \\nwill each member do? \\n• If I have a family history of breast cancer, what is \\nthe chance my cancer is hereditary (genetic)? \\n• Should I see a genetic counselor?

After this, the doctor will use a number of \\ntests and procedures to determine whether the mass is \\ncancerous and, if it is, to figure out if the cancer has spread. \\nNot every test is right for every person. Your doctor may \\nconsider factors such as your age, medical condition, signs \\nand symptoms, and previous test results when deciding \\nwhether a specific diagnostic test is right for you. \\nImaging tests \\n\\x86 Diagnostic mammography \\nMammography is a type of x-ray designed to view the breast. The x-ray films produced by mammography, called \\nmammograms, help doctors find small tumors or irregularities in the breast. Diagnostic mammography is similar to \\nscreening mammography except that more pictures are taken, and it is often used when a woman is experiencing signs, \\nsuch as nipple discharge or a new lump. Diagnostic mammography may also be used if something suspicious is found on \\na screening mammogram. \\n\\x86 Ultrasound \\nAn ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the breast tissue. An ultrasound can distinguish \\nbetween a solid mass, which may be cancer, and a fluid-filled cyst, which is usually not cancer. \\n\\x86 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) \\nAn MRI uses magnetic fields, not x-rays, to produce detailed images of the body. An MRI can also be used to measure a tumor’s \\nsize. A special dye called a contrast medium is injected into a patient’s vein or given as a liquid to swallow before the scan to \\nhelp create a clearer picture of the possible cancer.

Other tests can suggest \\nthat cancer is present, but only a biopsy can make a definite \\ndiagnosis. There are different types of biopsies, classified by \\nthe technique and/or size of the needle used to collect the \\ntissue sample. \\n\\x86 Fine needle aspiration biopsy \\nThis type of biopsy uses a thin needle to remove a small \\nsample of cells from a suspicious lump. \\n\\x86 Core needle biopsy \\nThis procedure uses a thicker needle to remove a larger \\nsample of tissue. It is usually the preferred biopsy technique \\nto find out whether an abnormality discovered during a \\nphysical examination or on an imaging test is cancer. A \\nvacuum-assisted biopsy removes several large cores of \\ntissue. Medication to block the awareness of pain, called \\nlocal anesthesia, is used to reduce a person’s discomfort \\nduring the procedure. \\n KAREN ELSHOUT PHOTOGRAPH \\n\\x86 Image-guided biopsy \\nThis test is done when a distinct lump can’t be felt, but \\nan abnormality is seen with an imaging test, such as on a \\nmammogram. An image-guided biopsy can be done using \\na fine needle, core needle, or vacuum-assisted needle, \\ndepending on the amount of tissue that needs to be \\nremoved. During the procedure, the needle is guided to the \\nbest location with the help of an imaging technique, such \\nas mammography, ultrasound, or MRI. A stereotactic biopsy \\nis done using mammography to help guide the needle. A \\nsmall metal clip may be put into the breast to mark where the \\nbiopsy sample was taken in case the tissue is cancerous and \\nmore surgery is needed. This clip is usually titanium so it will \\nnot cause problems with future imaging tests, but check with \\nyour doctor before you have any additional tests or scans. \\n\\x86 Surgical biopsy \\nThis type of biopsy removes the largest amount of tissue. \\nA surgical biopsy is either incisional if it removes part of the \\nlump or excisional if it removes the entire lump. Because \\nsurgery is best done after a cancer diagnosis has been made, \\na surgical biopsy is usually not the recommended procedure \\nfor diagnosing breast cancer. Most often, non-surgical core \\nbiopsies are recommended to diagnose breast cancer. This \\nmeans that only one surgical procedure is needed to remove \\nthe tumor and to take samples of the lymph nodes. \\nExamining the tissue \\nAfter a biopsy, a pathologist will look very closely at the \\ntissue that was removed using a microscope. Based on \\nthis examination, the pathologist can tell which area of the \\nbreast the cancer started in (ductal or lobular), whether the \\ntumor has spread outside this area (invasive or in situ), and \\nhow different the cancer cells look from healthy breast cells \\n(the grade). If the tumor was removed, the healthy tissue \\naround the edges of the tumor, called the margins, will \\nalso be examined to see if cancer cells are present and to \\nmeasure their distance from the tumor, which is referred to \\nas the margin width.'),\n",

This is done to identify \\nspecific genes, proteins, and other factors unique to your \\ntumor. The standard tests used to further evaluate invasive \\nbreast cancer include estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone \\nreceptor (PR), and HER2 tests. ER status is often determined \\nfor DCIS as well. \\n\\x86 ER and PR status \\nAbout 60% to 75% of breast cancers have estrogen and/or \\nprogesterone receptors. Breast cancer cells with these \\nreceptors depend on the hormones estrogen and/or \\nprogesterone to grow. The presence of these receptors \\nhelps determine the risk of the cancer coming back after \\ntreatment and the type of treatment most likely to lower this \\nrisk. Generally, hormonal therapy works well for ER-positive \\nand/or PR-positive cancers, also called hormone receptor-\\npositive cancers. \\n\\x86 HER2 status \\nAbout 20% to 25% of breast cancers have more copies than \\nusual of a gene called the human epidermal growth factor \\nreceptor 2 (HER2). Because this gene makes a protein that \\nfuels tumor cell growth, HER2-positive cancers may grow \\nmore quickly. The tumor’s HER2 status also helps determine \\nwhether drugs that target the HER2 might help treat the \\ncancer. These drugs include trastuzumab (Herceptin), \\npertuzumab (Perjeta), lapatinib (Tykerb), and neratinib \\n(Nerlynx). About 50% of HER2-positive tumors also have \\nhormone receptors, so patients can benefit from both \\ntypes of treatment. \\n\\x86 Triple-negative \\nIf a tumor does not express ER, PR, or HER2, the tumor is \\ncalled “triple-negative.” Triple-negative breast cancer makes \\nup about 15% of invasive breast cancers. Triple-negative \\nbreast cancer may be more common among younger \\nwomen, particularly younger black women. Triple-negative \\ncancer is also more common in women with a mutation \\nin the BRCA1  and BRCA2 genes. Experts recommend that \\nall people with triple-negative breast cancer be tested for \\nBRCA gene mutations. \\nGenomic testing of the tumor \\nTests that look at the biology of a tumor are sometimes \\nused to understand more about breast cancer, especially if \\nthe cancer has not spread to other parts of the body. These \\ntests can help choose the most effective type of treatment, \\npredict the risk of recurrence, and avoid possible side \\neffects of a treatment that is not likely to work well. \\nThe most common genomic test in the United States is \\ncalled Oncotype DX. This test evaluates 16 cancer-related \\ngenes and 5 reference genes to estimate the risk of the \\ncancer coming back in a place other than the breast and \\nnearby lymph nodes within 10 years after diagnosis. \\nThis test is usually used for patients with stage I or stage II \\nER-positive breast cancer. These results are mainly used to \\nhelp doctors decide whether chemotherapy should be \\nadded to treatment with hormonal therapy. \\nThere are other types of genomic tests that are less often \\nused. These include Breast Cancer Index, MammaPrint, and \\nProsigna (formerly called a PAM50 test).'),\n",

Doctors use diagnostic tests \\nto find out a cancer’s stage so information about staging may \\nnot be available until all the tests are finished. Knowing the \\nstage will help your doctor decide which treatment plan will \\nbe most effective and help predict your prognosis. \\nDoctors assign the stage of breast cancer using a number \\nzero (0) through 4 (Roman numerals I through IV). Doctors \\nmay refer to stage I and stage IIA cancer as “early stage” and \\nto stage IIB and stage III as “locally advanced.” Stage IV is \\ncalled “metastatic breast cancer.” \\nStage 0. The disease is only in the ducts and/or lobules \\nof the breast and has not spread to the surrounding breast \\ntissue. It is also called in situ or noninvasive cancer. \\nStage IA. The tumor is small and invasive, but it has not \\nspread to the lymph nodes. \\nStage IB. A small number of cancer cells have spread to \\nthe axillary lymph nodes under the arm and formed tiny \\nclusters larger than 0.2 mm but smaller than 2 mm in size. \\nThere is either no evidence of a tumor in the breast, or the \\ntumor in the breast is 20 mm or smaller. \\nStage IIA.

The goal of breast cancer surgery is to \\nremove the tumor along with a margin of healthy tissue \\naround it. Your surgical oncologist will guide you in the \\ndecision of what kind of surgery to consider and which \\nchoices are preferred depending on you and your breast \\ncancer diagnosis. Generally, the smaller the tumor, the \\nmore surgical options a person has. These options include: \\n\\x86 Lumpectomy \\nThis surgery removes the tumor as well as a small, cancer-\\nfree margin around it. Most of the breast remains. For \\ninvasive cancer, radiation therapy to the remaining breast \\ntissue is generally recommended after surgery. For DCIS, \\nradiation therapy after surgery may be an option depending \\non the patient and the tumor. A lumpectomy may also be \\ncalled breast-conserving surgery, a partial mastectomy, \\nquadrantectomy, or a segmental mastectomy. \\n\\x86 Mastectomy \\nThis surgery removes the entire breast and may or may not \\nbe combined with reconstructive surgery. There are several \\ntypes of mastectomies, and some can preserve the skin \\n(called a skin-sparing mastectomy) and the nipple (called a \\ntotal skin-sparing mastectomy). \\nSurgery is also used to evaluate nearby lymph nodes \\nfor cancer cells. This helps the doctor decide the most \\nappropriate treatment. Lymph nodes serve as collecting \\nstations for lymph, a clear fluid that flows throughout the \\nbody. As lymph drains out of the breast and into nearby \\nlymph nodes, it can transport cancer cells that may have \\ndetached from the original tumor before it was removed. \\nIf there is cancer in the lymph nodes, the cancer is called \\nlymph node-positive breast cancer or node-positive, for \\nshort. If there is no cancer in the lymph nodes, the cancer is \\ncalled lymph node-negative breast cancer or node-negative. \\nThe type of procedure you have will depend on a variety \\nof factors, including the type of breast cancer and whether \\nthere is obvious evidence of cancer in the lymph nodes \\nbefore surgery. The options are: \\n\\x86 Sentinel lymph node biopsy \\nDuring a sentinel lymph node biopsy, the surgeon finds and \\nremoves about 1 to 3 sentinel lymph nodes from under the \\n15'),\n",

Sentinel \\nlymph nodes are the first lymph nodes that are likely to \\ncollect cancer cells that have broken away from a tumor. \\nThe pathologist then examines these lymph nodes for \\ncancer cells. To find the sentinel lymph nodes, the surgeon \\ninjects a dye and/or a radioactive tracer into the area of the \\ncancer and/or around the nipple. The dye or tracer travels \\nto the lymph nodes, arriving at the sentinel nodes first. The \\nsurgeon can find these nodes when they change color (if the \\ndye is used) or gives off radiation (if the tracer is used). \\nIf the sentinel lymph nodes are cancer-free, research has \\nshown that there is a good possibility that the remaining \\nlymph nodes will also be free of cancer and no further surgery \\nwill be needed. If the sentinel lymph nodes show evidence \\nof cancer, usually no further surgery is needed. However, \\nthe surgeon may consider a dissection of the axillary lymph \\nnodes, located under the arms, to look for additional cancer \\ncells, depending on the type of breast surgery planned, the \\nstage of the cancer, and the number of cancer cells found in \\nthe sentinel lymph nodes. \\n\\x86 Axillary lymph node dissection \\nDuring an axillary lymph node dissection, the surgeon \\nremoves many lymph nodes from under the arm, which are \\nthen examined by a pathologist for cancer cells. Researchers \\nhave found that an axillary lymph node dissection may not \\nbe needed for all women with early-stage breast cancer \\nwho have small amounts of cancer in the sentinel lymph \\nnodes. Women having a lumpectomy and radiation therapy \\nwho have a smaller tumor and no more than 2 sentinel \\nlymph nodes with cancer may avoid a full axillary lymph \\nnode dissection, which helps reduce the risk of side effects \\nand does not decrease survival. \\nAfter a mastectomy or lumpectomy, the breast may be \\nscarred and may have a different shape or size than before \\nsurgery. The area around the surgical site may also become \\nharder. If any lymph nodes were removed as part of the \\nsurgery, or were affected during treatment, lymphedema \\nBILL WIPPERT \\nmay occur. Lymphedema is swelling of the hand and/or \\narm, and it is a life-long risk. \\nLymphedema develops when a blockage in the lymphatic \\nsystem makes fluid build up in the arm. Lymphedema may \\ndevelop immediately after surgery, or it may occur months \\nor even years after cancer treatment has ended.

A doctor who specializes \\nin giving radiation therapy to treat cancer is called a \\nradiation oncologist. \\nThe most common type of radiation therapy used to treat \\nbreast cancer is external-beam radiation therapy. It delivers \\nradiation from a machine located outside the body. Other \\ntypes of radiation therapy, such as intra-operative radiation \\ntherapy and brachytherapy, are used less often to treat \\nbreast cancer. \\nRADIATION THERAPY AFTER LUMPECTOMY \\nRadiation therapy is most often given after a lumpectomy \\nto help lower the risk of recurrence in the breast. \\nStandard radiation therapy after a lumpectomy is external-\\nbeam radiation therapy given Monday through Friday for 3 to \\n6 weeks. This often includes radiation therapy to the whole \\nbreast for the first few weeks, followed by a more focused \\ntreatment, called a boost, to the area in the breast where the \\ntumor was located for the remaining treatments. For women \\nwith a low risk of recurrence, the boost may be optional. \\nSome centers are studying and using a 5-day schedule of \\naccelerated partial breast radiation (PBI), a technique in which \\nradiation is given only to the tumor area and not the entire \\nbreast. It is important to discuss these treatment approaches \\nwith your doctor. \\nRADIATION THERAPY AFTER MASTECTOMY \\nRadiation therapy may also be recommended for some \\nwomen after a mastectomy, depending on her age; the size \\nof the tumor; the number of lymph nodes under the arm \\nthat contain cancer; the width of healthy tissue around the \\ntumor removed by the surgeon; the ER, PR, and HER2 status \\nof the tumor; and other factors. This treatment is given to \\nthe chest wall, Monday through Friday, for 5 to 6 weeks. \\nRarely, radiation therapy may be given before surgery to \\nshrink a large tumor, making it easier to remove. \\nRADIATION THERAPY SIDE EFFECTS \\nRadiation therapy causes side effects, including fatigue, \\nswelling of the breast, redness and/or skin discoloration, \\nand pain and/or burning in the skin where the radiation was \\ndirected, sometimes with blistering or peeling.

Hormonal therapy is also \\neffective as a treatment for metastatic breast cancer, shrinking \\nthe cancer and improving cancer-related symptoms. \\n\\x86 Tamoxifen (Nolvadex, Soltamox) \\nTamoxifen blocks estrogen from attaching to breast cancer \\ncells. It is effective at reducing the risk of recurrence in the \\nbreast that had cancer, the risk of developing cancer in the \\nother breast, and the risk of distant recurrence. It is also \\napproved to reduce the risk of breast cancer in women at \\nhigh risk for developing the disease and for reducing local \\nrecurrence for women with DCIS who had a lumpectomy. \\nThe side effects of tamoxifen include hot flashes; vaginal \\ndryness, discharge, or bleeding.

Research shows that all 3 AI \\ndrugs work equally well and have similar side effects, which \\nmay include muscle and joint stiffness and pain, hot flashes, \\nvaginal dryness, an increased risk of osteoporosis and \\nbroken bones, and higher cholesterol levels. \\nWomen who have not yet gone through menopause \\nshould not take AIs because they do not block the effects \\nof estrogen made by the ovaries. Often, doctors will \\nmonitor blood estrogen levels in women whose periods \\nhave recently stopped, or whose periods stop with \\nchemotherapy, to make sure the ovaries are no longer \\nproducing this hormone. \\n\\x86 Ovarian suppression \\nStopping the ovaries from making estrogen is one of \\nthe oldest hormonal treatments for hormone receptor-\\npositive breast cancer and for premenopausal women with \\nmetastatic breast cancer.

To make scientific \\nadvances, doctors conduct research studies involving \\nvolunteers, called clinical trials. \\nMany clinical trials focus on new \\ntreatments. Researchers want to \\nlearn if a new treatment is safe, \\neffective, and possibly better than \\nthe treatment doctors use now. \\nThese studies evaluate new drugs, \\ndifferent combinations of existing \\ntreatments, new approaches \\nto radiation therapy or surgery, \\nand new methods of treatment. \\nThere are also clinical trials that \\nstudy new ways to ease symptoms and side effects during \\ntreatment and ways to manage late effects that may occur \\nafter treatment. Clinical trials are often designed to be an \\noption at any point in a patient’s care, starting from the time \\nof diagnosis. \\nPatients who participate in clinical trials can be some of the \\nfirst to get a treatment before it is available to the public. \\nHowever, there are some risks with a clinical trial, including \\npossible side effects and that the new treatment may not \\nwork. People are encouraged to talk with their health care \\nteam about the pros and cons of joining a specific study. \\nPeople decide to participate in clinical trials for many \\nreasons. For some people with breast cancer, a clinical trial \\nis the best treatment option available. Because standard \\ntreatments are not perfect, patients are often willing to \\nface the added uncertainty of a clinical trial in the hope \\nof a better result. Other people volunteer for clinical trials \\nbecause they know these studies are a way to contribute to \\nthe progress in treating breast cancer. Even if they do not \\nbenefit directly from the clinical trial, their participation may \\nhelp other people with breast cancer in the future. \\nInsurance coverage of clinical trials costs differs by location \\nand by study. In some programs, some of the patient’s \\nexpenses from participating in the clinical trial are reimbursed. \\nIn others, they are not. It is important to talk with the research \\nteam and your insurance company first to learn if and how \\nyour treatment in a clinical trial will be covered. \\nSome people worry if they participate in a clinical trial they \\nmay receive no treatment by being given a placebo or a \\n“sugar pill.” Placebos are rarely used in cancer clinical trials. If a \\nplacebo is used, it is usually combined with standard treatment \\nin most cancer clinical trials. When a placebo is used in a \\nstudy, it is done with the full knowledge of the participants. \\nTo join a clinical trial, patients must participate in a process \\nknown as informed consent. During informed consent, the \\nresearch team should: \\n• Describe all of the patient’s options, so that the person \\nunderstands the standard treatment, and how the new \\ntreatment differs from the standard treatment. \\n• List all of the risks of the new treatment, which may or \\nmay not be different from the risks of standard treatment. \\n• Explain what will be required of each patient to \\nparticipate in the clinical trial, including the number of \\ndoctor visits, tests, and the schedule of treatment. \\nTo learn more about clinical trials, \\nvisit www.cancer.net/clinicaltrials. \\n27'),\n",

To make sure the entire tumor is removed, the \\nsurgeon will also remove a small area of healthy tissue \\naround the tumor. Although the goal of surgery is to \\nremove all of the visible cancer, microscopic cells \\nmay be left behind, either in the breast or elsewhere. \\nIn some situations, this means another surgery could \\nbe needed to remove any remaining cancer cells. \\nFor larger invasive cancers, or those that are growing more \\nquickly, doctors may recommend neoadjuvant treatment \\nwith chemotherapy before surgery. Neoadjuvant hormonal \\ntherapy may also be recommended in specific situations. \\nAfter surgery, the next step in managing early-stage invasive \\nbreast cancer is to reduce the risk of recurrence by getting \\nrid of any remaining cancer cells using adjuvant therapies \\nlike radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, \\nand/or hormonal therapy. Whether adjuvant therapy is \\nneeded depends on the likelihood that any cancer cells \\nremain in the breast or the body and the chance that a \\nspecific treatment will work to treat the cancer. Although \\nadjuvant therapy lowers the risk of recurrence, it does not \\ncompletely get rid of this risk. \\nRECURRENT BREAST CANCER \\nIf breast cancer returns after treatment for early-stage \\ndisease, it is called recurrent cancer. Cancer recurs \\nbecause tiny areas of cancer cells are difficult to find and \\nsometimes remain in the body after treatment. Over time, \\nthese cells may multiply and grow large enough to be \\nfound and diagnosed. \\nBreast cancer may come back in the same breast (called \\na local recurrence), in the chest wall or lymph nodes \\nunder the arm (regional recurrence), or in another part \\nof the body, such as the bones, lungs, liver, and brain \\n(distant recurrence). \\nIf a recurrence occurs, the cycle of testing will begin again \\nto learn as much as possible about the recurrence, including \\nwhether the cancer’s stage has changed. A biopsy of the \\nsite is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and to check \\nfor ER, PR, and HER2 status because this may have changed \\nsince the cancer was first diagnosed. \\nThe treatment of recurrent \\nbreast cancer depends on \\nthe previous treatment(s), \\nthe time since the original \\ndiagnosis, the location \\nof the recurrence, and \\nthe characteristics of the \\ntumor, such as ER, PR, and \\nHER2 status. \\nLOCAL OR REGIONAL \\nRECURRENCE \\nFor women who develop a local recurrence within the breast \\nafter having a lumpectomy followed by radiation therapy, the \\nrecommended treatment is a mastectomy. Usually the cancer \\nis completely removed during this surgery. \\nFor women who develop a local or regional recurrence in \\nthe chest wall after having a mastectomy, surgical removal \\nof the recurrent cancer followed by radiation therapy to'),\n",

Some patients live for years after a distant \\nrecurrence of breast cancer. \\nWomen with recurrent breast cancer often experience \\nemotions such as disbelief or fear. Patients are encouraged \\nto talk with their health care team about these feelings and \\nask about support services to help them cope. \\nMETASTATIC BREAST CANCER \\nIf breast cancer has spread to another location in the body, \\nor come back in another location, it is called metastatic \\ncancer. People with this diagnosis are encouraged to talk \\nwith doctors who are experienced in treating this stage \\nof cancer because there can be different opinions about \\nthe best treatment plan. You may want to seek a second \\nopinion before starting treatment so you are comfortable \\nwith your treatment plan. \\nThe primary goals of treatment for metastatic breast cancer \\nare to extend or prolong life and to relieve the symptoms \\ncaused by the cancer. Your health care team may \\nrecommend a treatment plan that combines chemotherapy, \\ntargeted therapy, radiation therapy, and/or hormonal \\ntherapy to shrink the cancer. Because it is not unusual for \\nmetastatic breast cancer to stop responding to various \\ndrug combinations, you may need to change therapies \\nfairly often. Palliative care will also be important to help \\nrelieve symptoms and side effects. \\nFor most patients, a diagnosis of metastatic cancer is very \\nstressful and, at times, difficult to bear. Patients and their \\nfamilies are encouraged to talk about the way they are feeling \\nwith doctors, nurses, social workers, or other members of \\nthe health care team.

However, it is \\nimportant to know that up to 95% of cancer pain can be treated successfully \\nusing medication or other strategies.

Lymphedema is the abnormal buildup of \\nfluid in soft tissue, typically in an arm, caused by a blockage \\nin the lymphatic system. It can happen immediately after \\nsurgery or radiation therapy, or months or years after \\ncancer treatment has ended. In some cases, the swelling \\ngoes away on its own as the body heals and normal lymph \\nfluid flow resumes. However, lymphedema may become \\nchronic when the lymphatic system changes and can no \\nlonger meet the body’s demands for fluid drainage. There \\nis no cure for chronic lymphedema; however, there are \\nways to keep it from getting worse. Talk with a member of \\nyour health care team about the best way to prevent and \\nmanage lymphedema. \\nInfertility. Some treatments for breast cancer may cause \\ntemporary or permanent infertility, which is the inability to \\nbecome pregnant or have children. If this is a concern for \\nyou, talk with your doctor before treatment begins about \\nthe possible fertility-related side effects of your treatment \\nplan and the options for preserving your fertility. \\nNausea and vomiting. \\nNausea and vomiting are \\ncommon side effects of \\nmany cancer treatments. \\nNausea is feeling the urge \\nto vomit or throw up. \\nVomiting may happen \\nbefore treatment as a \\nresult of anxiety, within 24 \\nhours after treatment, or 2 \\nor more days after treatment. Mild nausea and vomiting can \\nbe uncomfortable, but they usually do not cause serious \\nproblems. Severe vomiting, on the other hand, can cause \\ndehydration, electrolyte imbalances (loss of minerals from \\nthe body, such as potassium and sodium), weight loss, and \\ndepression. In addition to medications that help prevent \\nnausea and vomiting, many people find that behavioral \\ntreatments help control these side effects. Talk with your \\nhealth care team about ways to change the expectation and \\nfear of nausea and vomiting. \\nHair loss. Many chemotherapy drugs can cause partial or \\ncomplete hair loss. Hair may fall out entirely, gradually, or \\nin sections. In some cases, hair may simply become thin, \\nduller, or dryer. Hair loss is most noticeable on the scalp, \\nbut it may affect other parts of the body, such as the face \\n(eyebrows and eyelashes), arms, legs, underarms, and pubic \\narea. Hair loss is usually temporary, and in most cases, hair \\nwill grow back after treatment has finished. \\nChemobrain. Cancer survivors commonly use the term \\n“chemobrain” to describe difficulties thinking clearly after \\ncancer treatment. This also can occur in patients who did not \\nreceive chemotherapy as part of breast cancer treatment. \\nCognitive side effects vary and sometimes make it hard to \\ncomplete daily activities. People who experience severe \\nproblems concentrating, multitasking, or understanding or \\nremembering things should talk with their doctor or another \\nmember of the health care team to learn about medication, \\ncognitive rehabilitation and training, and other ways to \\nmanage these challenges. \\nEmotional and social effects \\nFor many people, the diagnosis and treatment of breast \\ncancer is stressful and can trigger difficult emotions. \\nPhysical changes that occur during treatment, such \\nas having a breast removed, hair loss, weight gain or \\nweight loss, or scars from surgery, may make you feel \\nuncomfortable and self-conscious.

The tumor does not \\nusually invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of \\nthe body. \\nBiopsy: The removal of a small amount of tissue for \\nexamination under a microscope. Other tests can suggest \\nbreast cancer is present, but only a biopsy can make a \\ndefinite diagnosis. \\nBone-modifying drugs:  Medications, such as \\nbisphosphonates and denosumab, used to help strengthen \\nbones and reduce pain and bone breaks caused by bone \\nmetastases. They may also be used to prevent cancer from \\nrecurring in the bone or to treat cancer that has spread to \\nthe bone. \\nBrachytherapy: Radiation treatment given using a probe in \\nthe operating room or by placing small radioactive “seeds” \\nor pellets inside the body near the tumor.

Invasive \\nbreast cancer has spread beyond the ducts or lobules into healthy breast tissue, or beyond the breast to lymph \\nnodes or distant organs (Stages I IV).\\n• Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths in women and occurs most frequently in \\npostmenopausal women over the age of 50. Breast cancer also occurs in men but is very rare, making up around \\n1% of all breast cancer cases.\\nDiagnosis of breast cancer\\n• The most common symptoms of breast cancer are changes in the breasts such as the presence of a lump, \\nchanges to the nipple, discharge from the nipple or changes in the skin of the breast.\\n• Initial investigations for breast cancer begin with a physical examination, mammography and ultrasound \\nscan. In some cases, breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will also be performed. If a tumour is \\nfound, a biopsy will be taken to assess the cancer before any treatment is planned.\\nTreatment options for breast cancer\\n• The treatment of breast cancer depends on how far advanced the cancer is (Stage 0 IV) and what type of \\ncancer is present. \\n• Surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy and targeted therapy are used in the \\ntreatment of breast cancer.\\n• Breast cancer is ‘staged’ according to tumour  size, involvement of lymph nodes and whether it has spread \\noutside the breast and lymph nodes  to other parts of the body, according to the TNM system (T – tumour , \\nN – nodes, M – metastases). This information is used to help decide the best treatment.\\n• The presence of biomarkers  including hormone receptors and a receptor called HER2  also help to \\ndetermine what type of therapy is given. \\nEarly stage non-invasive breast cancer Biological testing of the tumour\\n• Patients with Stage 0 disease will usually have the tumour removed by breast-conserving surgery  or \\nmastectomy. Radiotherapy is given after breast-conserving surgery but is not usually needed after \\nmastectomy. Most patients with oestrogen receptor (ER)  positive cancer will be given endocrine \\ntherapy after surgery and radiotherapy . Endocrine therapy is given to decrease the risk of recurrence \\n(the cancer coming back), as well as prevention of new cancers in both the remaining and contralateral breast.'),\n",

Breast-conserving surgery is always followed by radiotherapy. Most patients will then receive \\nadjuvant therapy with one or a combination of systemic treatments, depending on the type of cancer present.\\n• Some patients, particularly those with larger tumours , may receive preoperative neoadjuvant systemic  \\ntherapy to shrink the tumour  and improve the likelihood of successful surgical removal of the tumour , or to \\ndecrease the extent of surgery (which can also achieve a better cosmetic result).\\n• The standard chemotherapy regimens in early breast cancer usually contain anthracyclines  (e.g. \\nepirubicin or doxorubicin) and/or taxanes (e.g. paclitaxel or docetaxel), given sequentially.\\n• Patients with ER positive disease will receive endocrine therapy. In premenopausal women this is usually \\ntamoxifen alone or in combination with drugs that suppress the ovarian production of oestrogen  (called \\ngonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues). Suppression of ovarian function may also be used with \\naromatase inhibitors. In postmenopausal women, aromatase inhibitors  or tamoxifen are used, either \\nalone or sequentially. \\n• Patients with HER2  positive breast cancer will usually receive the anti- HER2 drug trastuzumab as well as \\nchemotherapy. In some patients, this may also be combined with pertuzumab . Neratinib is a new anti-\\nHER2 agent that may also be used to treat HER2  positive disease.\\nLocally-advanced and metastatic breast cancer (also called advanced breast cancer)\\n• Most patients whose breast cancer has been classed as Stage IIB III will receive neoadjuvant  therapy \\nbefore surgery is performed. Depending on the type of breast cancer, this can include one or a combination \\nof chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, anti-HER2 therapy and radiotherapy.\\n• Patients with Stage IV breast cancer will not usually be treated with surgery, but it may be discussed in some cases. \\n• ER positive advanced disease is usually treated with endocrine therapy  using aromatase inhibitors, \\ntamoxifen or fulvestrant. In some cases, these drugs are combined with targeted therapies  such \\nas cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors ( palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib) or \\nmechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (everolimus) to improve outcomes.\\n• For ER negative tumours  and for ER positive tumours that have stopped responding to endocrine \\ntherapy, chemotherapy with capecitabine, vinorelbine or eribulin is usually used. A taxane  or an \\nanthracycline may also be used in some patients. \\n• HER2-positive advanced disease is usually treated with trastuzumab  and pertuzumab in combination \\nwith chemotherapy (docetaxel, paclitaxel, vinorelbine or capecitabine). Further-line treatments \\ninclude trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), trastuzumab in combination with lapatinib, lapatinib in \\ncombination with capecitabine or trastuzumab in combination with other chemotherapy  agents. \\n• Bevacizumab can be combined with chemotherapy  but provides only a small benefit with no impact on \\nsurvival, and is therefore rarely used. Olaparib  and talazoparib are new targeted therapies that may be \\nused to treat BRCA -associated advanced breast cancer (i.e. hereditary advanced breast cancer).'),\n",

In this type of cancer, the cancer cells are in the ducts  of the breast but have not \\nspread into the healthy breast tissue.\\nLobular neoplasia (previously called lobular carcinoma in situ ) is when there are changes in the cells lining \\nthe lobules, which indicate that there is an increased risk of developing breast cancer in the future. Lobular \\nneoplasia is not actually breast cancer, and although women with lobular neoplasia will have regular check-ups, \\nmost will not develop breast cancer.\\nInvasive breast cancer\\nInvasive breast cancer is the name given to a cancer that has spread outside the ducts  (invasive ductal breast \\ncancer) or lobules (invasive lobular breast cancer). These can be further classified by their histology; for \\nexample, tubular, mucinous, medullary and papillary breast tumours  are rarer subtypes of breast cancer.\\nBreast cancer is also categorised by how advanced the disease is: \\nDuct\\nSkin\\nFatty tissue\\nNipple\\nAreola\\nLobules\\nChest wall\\nRib\\nChest wall muscles'),\n",

These cancers are usually operable and the primary treatment is often \\nsurgery to remove the cancer, although many patients also have preoperative neoadjuvant systemic  therapy. \\nLocally-advanced breast cancer\\nBreast cancer is locally-advanced if it has spread from the breast to nearby tissue or lymph nodes  (Stage IIB \\nIII). In the vast majority of patients, treatment for locally-advanced breast cancer starts with systemic  therapies. \\nDepending on how far the cancer has spread, locally-advanced tumours  may be either operable or inoperable \\n(in which case surgery may still be performed if the tumour  shrinks after systemic  treatment). \\nMetastatic breast cancer\\nBreast cancer is described as metastatic when it has spread to other parts of the body, such as the bones, liver \\nor lungs (also called Stage IV). Tumours  at distant sites are called metastases . Metastatic breast cancer is not \\ncurable but is treatable.\\nAdvanced breast cancer\\nAdvanced breast cancer is a term used to describe both locally-advanced inoperable breast cancer and \\nmetastatic breast cancer. \\nSubtypes based on hormone receptor status and HER2 gene expression\\n• The growth of some tumours is stimulated by the hormones oestrogen  and progesterone. It is important \\nto find out whether a tumour is oestrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PgR) positive or \\nnegative, as tumours with a high level of hormone receptors can be treated with drugs that reduce the supply \\nof hormone to the tumour. \\nHER2 is also a receptor that is involved in the growth of cells and is present in about 20% of breast cancers. \\nTumours that have a high level of HER2  can be treated with anti- HER2 drugs. \\nTumours that don’t have ER , PgR or high levels of HER2 are described as triple-negative tumours . \\nTumours can be classified into subtypes based on hormonal and HER2  receptor status as follows: luminal \\nA-like (ER and PgR positive, HER2 negative tumours), luminal B-like ( ER and/or PgR positive,  HER2 positive \\nor negative tumours), HER2 overexpressing ( ER and PgR negative, HER2  positive tumours) and basal-like \\n(triple-negative tumours ). \\nFurther information regarding the impact of these subtypes on breast cancer treatment will be explained later in \\nthis guide in the section: ‘ How will my treatment be determined?’.'),\n",

In developed countries, 1 in every 8 women \\nwill develop breast cancer in their lifetime. In Europe, there is a breast cancer diagnosis every 2 minutes and \\na death due to breast cancer every 6 minutes. Breast cancer mostly affects older women, with the majority of \\npatients being over the age of 50 when diagnosed, although around 1 in 5 breast cancers are diagnosed before \\nthe age of 50. Breast cancer in men is rare and makes up around 1% of breast cancer cases. \\nFemale breast cancer incidence rates vary widely between regions, with the highest incidence rates in Western \\nEurope and the United States, and the lowest in Africa and Asia. Higher breast cancer incidence in more \\ndeveloped countries reflects the presence of more breast cancer risk factors in these countries (Torre et al. 2016). \\nHowever, the incidence of breast cancer in developing countries is rapidly increasing. Despite higher incidence \\nrates, deaths due to breast cancer in most Western countries have decreased in recent years due to improved \\ntreatment and earlier detection, but have substantially increased in developing countries.

Your breasts will each be placed on the \\nx-ray machine and pressed between two plates \\nto produce a clear image. If the mammography  \\nscreening shows anything suspicious in your \\nbreast tissue, your doctor will investigate further. \\n• Ultrasound scan: Ultrasound uses high-\\nfrequency sound waves to create an image of the \\ninside of your body. In investigations for breast \\ncancer, a hand-held ultrasound  device lets the \\ndoctor examine your breasts and the lymph \\nnodes in your armpit. The ultrasound  can show \\nwhether a lump is solid or is a fluid-filled cyst.\\n• MRI scan: MRI uses magnetic fields and radio \\nwaves to produce detailed images of the inside \\nof your body. An MRI scanner is usually a large \\ntube that contains powerful magnets. You lie \\ninside the tube during the scan, which takes \\n15–90 minutes. Although these are not used as \\npart of routine investigations, an MRI  scan might \\nbe used in certain circumstances, for example in \\npatients with a family history of breast cancer, BRCA  mutations, breast implants, lobular cancers, if there \\nis a suspicion of multiple tumours, or if the results of other imaging techniques are inconclusive (Cardoso et al. \\n2018 [in press]).

Some of these factors can be determined \\nfrom a biopsy, but others may only be determined after surgery has taken place to remove the tumour . \\nHistology\\nThe histology of a breast cancer tells us which tissues of the breast the cancer has formed in (ductal or lobular \\ncarcinomas) and whether it is invasive  or non-invasive. Histology can also reveal some of the rarer subtypes \\nof breast cancer, including the following:\\n• Tubular breast cancers are usually small and are made up of tube-shaped structures called ‘tubules’. These \\ntumours are usually low- grade, meaning that their cells look similar to normal, healthy cells and tend to \\ngrow slowly.\\n• Mucinous breast tumours  are made up of abnormal cells that float in pools of mucin (the main ingredient of \\nmucus). These tumours usually respond well to treatment.\\n• Medullary breast tumours  are soft, fleshy masses which tend to grow slowly and don’t usually spread \\noutside the breast.\\n• Papillary breast tumours  are made up of small, finger-like projections. These tumours  are usually \\nmoderate- grade, meaning that their cells don’t look like normal cells and are growing and dividing a little \\nfaster than normal.\\nGrade\\nGrade is based on how different tumour  cells look from normal breast cells, and on how quickly they grow. \\nThe grade will be a value between one and three and reflects the aggressiveness of tumour  cells; the higher the \\ngrade, the more aggressive the tumour . \\nHormone receptor status and HER2 gene expression\\nOestrogen and progesterone are sex hormones that are naturally present in women. Some breast tumours  \\ndepend on a supply of oestrogen  and/or progesterone to grow; these types of tumour  have a high number of \\nreceptors ( ER or PgR) that the hormones attach to in order to stimulate growth of the tumour . Tumours with \\nexpression of ER  are called ER positive tumours and can be treated by reducing the supply of oestrogen  to \\nthe tumour, typically by blocking the ER or limiting the levels of oestrogen  in the blood. \\nHER2 receptors are expressed on the surface of all cells and are involved in the normal processes of cell growth, \\nmultiplication and repair. About 20% of breast cancers have abnormally high levels of HER2  on the surface of \\nthe tumour cells and are therefore called HER2  positive tumours. These tumours tend to grow faster and are \\nmore likely to spread compared with HER2  negative breast cancers. HER2  positive breast cancer can be treated \\nwith drugs that block HER2  receptors to stop the uncontrolled growth of the tumour .'),\n",

Another technique, called in situ \\nhybridisation can also be used to localise specific \\ngenes, allowing doctors to see if breast cancer cells \\nhave extra copies of the HER2  gene. Expression \\nof hormone receptors and HER2  can vary between \\ndifferent parts of a tumour , therefore hormone \\nreceptor negative and HER2  negative biopsy specimens are usually retested on the tumour  tissue removed by \\nsurgery (Cardoso et al. 2018 [in press]). \\nProliferation markers\\nOther biomarkers may also be evaluated in the \\ntumour biopsy/surgery specimen.

The choice and \\ncombination of treatments will be discussed with you and your preferences will be taken into account. \\nOne of the most important decisions you will have to make is where to be treated. Treatment within a \\nmultidisciplinary and specialised team improves survival and quality of life, as opposed to being treated by a \\nsingle doctor. All of your treatment decisions should be taken after discussion in a multidisciplinary meeting, \\nwhere doctors from different specialties, nurses and other health professionals involved in your care will discuss \\nyour case and decide which treatment is the best option for you.\\nSurgery\\nThe two types of surgery for breast cancer are breast-\\nconserving surgery , in which the surgical team \\nremoves the tumour but tries to keep as much of the \\nbreast as possible, or mastectomy, in which the whole \\nbreast is removed. If the lymph nodes in your armpit \\nlook like they are clear of cancer in imaging tests, \\nthen a technique called sentinel lymph node biopsy \\nshould be performed. This identifies the most important \\n(sentinel) lymph node and examines it; if no cancer is \\ndetected, then no other lymph nodes  will be removed, \\nbut if cancer is found in that lymph node, more nodes \\nmay have to be removed (called axillary dissection). Patients undergoing mastectomy  should usually be offered \\nimmediate or delayed breast reconstruction, except in the case of inflammatory breast cancer.\\nRadiotherapy\\nRadiotherapy is a type of treatment that uses ionising radiation , which damages the DNA of cancerous cells, \\ncausing the cells to die. Radiotherapy  is usually given after breast-conserving surgery and may also be \\ngiven after mastectomy. Radiotherapy may also be given to patients with locally-advanced disease which \\nremains inoperable after systemic  treatment and may be considered in certain patients with metastatic disease \\nto treat the symptoms of the primary tumour  or distant metastases and improve quality of life. \\nRadiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery is usually given as whole breast radiotherapy (WBRT). In \\npatients considered to be at high risk of recurrence who have already undergone WBRT , a radiotherapy ‘boost’ \\nmay be given – this is an extra, lower dose of radiation directed specifically to the area that the tumour  was \\nremoved from. This may be done similarly to WBRT  with external radiotherapy  or with brachytherapy, in which \\na radiation source is placed into the breast tissue for a short time to provide internal radiotherapy  focused only \\non a small margin of tissue surrounding the site of surgery.'),\n",

This \\ntreatment is shorter than WBRT and reduces the exposure of healthy breast tissue and other organs in the chest \\n(e.g. heart, lungs) to radiation, reducing the risk of long-term side effects. \\nSome patients also require radiotherapy  after mastectomy, because of the presence of factors that increase \\nthe risk of the cancer coming back. This is done similarly to radiotherapy  after breast-conserving surgery.\\nSystemic therapy\\nThere are several types of systemic  therapy that you may be treated with, depending on the type and stage of \\ncancer you have.\\nChemotherapy\\nChemotherapy destroys cancer cells and is used to treat most triple negative, HER2 positive and luminal B-like \\nbreast cancers. Chemotherapy  is usually given every 1–3 weeks as intravenous  infusions. Some patients may \\nalso be offered additional oral chemotherapy  following completion of standard intravenous chemotherapy .\\nEndocrine therapies\\nEndocrine therapies aim to reduce the effects of oestrogen in ER positive breast cancers. This is the most \\nimportant type of systemic  treatment for ER positive tumours, also called hormone-dependent tumours . \\nThere are a number of types of endocrine therapy  available, which are taken orally or administered as an \\ninjection: \\n• Selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) block ER  on breast cells to prevent oestrogen  \\nattaching to the receptors. Tamoxifen  is a type of SERM.\\n• Selective oestrogen receptor downregulators (SERDs), such as fulvestrant , work in a similar way to \\nSERMs, but also reduce the number of ER s. \\n• Ovarian function suppression by gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues or by surgery may \\nbe offered to pre- and perimenopausal women to reduce the supply of oestrogen  from the ovaries to the \\ntumour.\\n• Aromatase inhibitors reduce the production of oestrogen in tissues and organs other than the ovaries, \\nand is therefore effective only in postmenopausal women, unless the function of the ovaries is suppressed \\n(oestrogen levels are artificially lowered) in premenopausal women. Anastrozole , letrozole and \\nexemestane are all aromatase inhibitors.'),\n",

A number of targeted therapies are used in the treatment of breast cancer:\\n• Anti-HER2 agents act on the HER2  receptor to block signalling and reduce cell proliferation in HER2  \\npositive breast cancers. Trastuzumab , lapatinib, pertuzumab and trastuzumab emtansine (TDM-1) \\nare all currently-used anti- HER2 agents. Neratinib is a new anti- HER2 agent that may also be used to treat \\nHER2 positive disease.\\n• Inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6 (CDK4/6) reduce cellular proliferation in tumours . \\nPalbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib are CDK4/6 inhibitors used in the treatment of breast cancer. \\n• Inhibitors of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), such as everolimus, reduce the growth and \\nproliferation of tumour cells stimulated by mTOR signalling.\\n• Inhibitors of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) make it difficult for cancer cells to fix damaged DNA, \\nwhich can cause cancer cells to die. Olaparib  and talazoparib are new PARP inhibitors that may be used \\nto treat some patients with a BRCA  mutation.\\n• Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors, such as bevacizumab, stop tumours from \\nstimulating blood vessel growth within the tumour , thereby starving them of the oxygen and nutrients they \\nneed to continue growing. \\nOther treatments\\nPatients with bone metastases  should be treated with bone-modifying drugs such as bisphosphonates  or \\ndenosumab, in combination with calcium and vitamin D supplements. These agents strengthen the bone, \\nreducing bone pain and the risk of fractures. Bisphosphonates  are also used in the postoperative treatment of \\nearly breast cancer, as they may reduce the risk of recurrence.'),\n",

This is \\nmost effectively achieved with  targeted therapies (including endocrine therapy), which are typically used \\nas the primary treatment in the majority of patients. In addition to systemic  treatments, patients may receive \\nradiotherapy (e.g. to reduce bone pain associated with bone metastases , for brain metastases and to reduce \\nbleeding caused by tumours  in soft tissue) or surgery (e.g. to relieve the pressure of a tumour  pressing on \\nthe spinal cord, or to remove brain metastases ).

Occasionally, ER-positive patients \\nmay require chemotherapy because the cancer is particularly aggressive. Chemotherapies are usually given \\nsequentially for metastatic disease but may be given in combination if the cancer is progressing quickly. \\nPatients are usually treated with capecitabine , vinorelbine or eribulin. Taxanes or anthracyclines may \\nbe used again if they have been given before as neoadjuvant  or adjuvant therapy, if the patient has been \\nconsidered to be ‘disease-free’ for at least 1 year and the doctor considers it safe. There are also several other \\nchemotherapy choices which your doctor may discuss with you (Cardoso et al. 2018). A platinum-containing \\nchemotherapy such as carboplatin or cisplatin might also be used in patients with triple-negative disease \\nwho have been treated with anthracyclines  previously.\\nEndocrine therapy for advanced disease\\nER positive, HER2 negative advanced disease \\nshould almost always be initially treated with \\nendocrine therapy: an aromatase inhibitor, \\ntamoxifen or fulvestrant (Cardoso et al. 2018).

Further treatment lines may include combinations of trastuzumab with other \\nchemotherapy drugs, or a combination of lapatinib and capecitabine. \\nMetastatic breast cancer is not curable but can \\nbe treated with an increasing choice of therapies\\nOther targeted therapies\\nCDK4/6 inhibitors ( palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib) are an option for the treatment of ER positive \\nadvanced breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor  or fulvestrant (Ibrance SPC, 2017; Kisqali SPC, \\n2017; Cardoso et al. 2018).\\nEverolimus in combination with exemestane , tamoxifen or fulvestrant is a treatment option for some \\npostmenopausal patients with ER positive  advanced breast cancer which has progressed after treatment with a \\nnon-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (Cardoso et al. 2018).\\nThe new agents olaparib and talazoparib are PARP inhibitors that may be used as an alternative to \\nchemotherapy in patients with BRCA1/2 mutations.\\nBevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel or capecitabine is approved in Europe for the first-line treatment of \\nmetastatic breast cancer (Avastin SPC, 2017); however, this treatment is not currently recommended in European treatment \\nguidelines for routine use as it only provides moderate benefits to some patients (Cardoso et al. 2018).'),\n",

In general, BRCA-associated early breast cancers are treated in a similar way to other breast cancers, \\nand adjuvant therapies should be given according to clinical need (Paluch-Shimon et al. 2016). As with non- BRCA \\ntriple-negative breast cancer, carboplatin  is recommended for BRCA -associated advanced triple-negative \\ndisease (Cardoso et al. 2018). In BRCA-associated triple-negative or ER-positive tumours  resistant to endocrine \\ntherapies, olaparib or talazoparib might be an alternative to chemotherapy .\\nBreast cancer and pregnancy\\nThere is no contraindication to becoming pregnant \\nafter having breast cancer. There are, however, several \\nimportant points to consider, especially in the case of \\nER positive breast cancer, due to the long duration \\nof endocrine therapy. Endocrine therapy must \\nbe stopped before trying to get pregnant and should \\nbe resumed after delivery and breastfeeding. If you \\nwish to get pregnant, please discuss all of the issues \\ncarefully with your doctor.\\nTreating breast cancer that occurs during pregnancy \\nis a very difficult situation that should be handled by an experienced team. In the vast majority of cases, there \\nis no need to terminate the pregnancy (i.e. there is no need to have an abortion). Terminating the pregnancy \\ndoes not improve the prognosis  of the mother. However, this is a delicate decision that must be taken by the \\nwoman and her partner, after being well informed of all available options. Several types of treatment are possible \\nduring pregnancy, depending on the trimester (Peccatori et al. 2013). Surgery is usually safe in any trimester. \\nChemotherapy is safe during the second and third trimesters; anthracycline -based chemotherapy is usually \\nthe first choice of treatment in pregnancy and taxanes  may also be used. Endocrine and anti- HER2 therapies \\ncan only be given after the baby is born. Radiotherapy  is usually postponed until after the baby is born. The \\nmost important factor for the baby is to avoid premature birth.\\nYoung women\\nIn younger, premenopausal patients, treatment for breast cancer can reduce fertility and can cause an early or \\ntemporary menopause. Before starting treatment, your doctor will discuss all possible fertility issues with you \\nand will give you information about any suitable fertility-preservation options available to you  (Peccatori et al. 2013, \\nCardoso et al. 2018).'),\n",

It is important to understand that a lack of menstruation  does \\nnot mean you are postmenopausal, therefore you will still need to take contraceptive  measures.\\nBreast cancer treatment can affect fertility  \\nin young women, but fertility-preservation \\nmeasures are available\\nOlder women\\nDoctors will use your biological age rather than your chronological age  when deciding on the best treatment \\nfor you – this means that if you are a fit and healthy elderly patient, you are likely to receive identical treatments \\nto younger patients, with full doses of drugs (Cardoso et al. 2018). If you are frail, it may be necessary to adjust \\nstandard treatments to balance the benefits of the treatment against the risks for you. \\nMen\\nAlmost all cases of breast cancer in men are hormone \\nreceptor-positive for both oestrogen  and androgen \\nhormone receptors. Therefore, if you are told you \\nhave a triple-negative or HER2  positive breast \\ncancer, you should ask for a second pathology \\nopinion. Approaches to surgery and radiotherapy  \\nare similar to those used in female breast cancer. \\nAlthough mastectomy is more common than breast-\\nconserving surgery, the latter is also possible, as \\nwell as some forms of less invasive mastectomy  \\nsuch as nipple-sparing mastectomy  (removal of \\nbreast tissue without removal of the skin, nipple or \\nareola). Tamoxifen is the standard adjuvant endocrine therapy (Cardoso et al. 2018). For male metastatic breast \\ncancer, endocrine therapy with tamoxifen is standard, but an aromatase inhibitor in combination with \\ngonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues or surgical removal of the testicles to reduce androgen  levels \\n(orchiectomy), may also be considered (Cardoso et al. 2018). The current recommendations for chemotherapy  \\nand anti- HER2 therapy are the same as for breast cancer in females (Cardoso et al. 2018).'),\n",

The most \\ncommon side effects for each type of treatment are \\nsummarised below, along with some information on \\nhow they can be managed. You may experience side \\neffects other than those discussed here. It is important \\nto talk to your doctor or nurse specialist about any \\npotential side effects that are worrying you. \\nDoctors classify side effects from any cancer therapy \\nby assigning each event a “Grade”, on a scale of \\n1–4, by increasing severity. Grade 1 side effects are \\nconsidered to be mild, Grade 2 moderate, Grade 3 severe, and Grade 4 very severe. However, the precise criteria \\nused to assign a grade to a specific side effect varies depending on which side effect is being considered. The \\naim is always to identify and address any side effect before it becomes severe, so you should always report any \\nworrying symptoms to your doctor or nurse specialist  as soon as possible.\\nIt is important to talk to your doctor or nurse \\nspecialist about any treatment-related side \\neffects that are worrying you\\nFatigue is very common in patients undergoing cancer treatment and can result from either the cancer itself or \\nthe treatments.

It affects up to 25% of patients after axillary lymph node  removal, but is \\nless common after sentinel lymph node biopsy , affecting less than 10% of patients (Cardoso et al. 2018 [in press]). \\nYou can reduce your risk of lymphoedema  in several ways:\\n• Maintain a healthy body weight to reduce the strain on your lymphatic system\\n• Use the arm on the operated side normally to encourage lymphatic drainage, and exercise regularly\\n• Protect your skin to avoid infection \\n - Moisturise the skin in the area to prevent cracked skin\\n - Use sunscreen to prevent sunburn\\n - Apply insect repellent to prevent bites\\n - Wear oven gloves when cooking\\n - Wear protective gloves when gardening\\nIf you notice any signs of swelling or infection, tell your doctor or nurse specialist as soon as possible.\\nFollowing surgery, your arm and shoulder on the operated side may feel stiff and sore for several weeks. Your \\nnurse specialist or a physiotherapist can give you some gentle exercises to help you regain the movement you \\nhad before the operation. \\nRadiotherapy\\nThere are several common side effects of radiotherapy , including fatigue and skin irritation, aches and \\nswelling in the treated breast. Let your doctor know of any symptoms as he/she may be able to help; for example, \\ncreams or dressings can help with skin irritation. You should also avoid exposing the treated area to sun for at \\nleast a year after treatment. As radiotherapy  for breast cancer will also result in some irradiation to the heart \\nand lungs, the risk of heart disease and lung cancer (particularly in people who smoke) may be slightly higher \\nin patients who have undergone radiotherapy  (Henson et al. 2013). However, modern radiotherapy techniques \\nminimise this risk.\\nChemotherapy\\nSide effects from chemotherapy  vary depending upon the drugs and doses used – you may experience some \\nof the side effects listed below but you are very unlikely to get all of them. Patients who receive a combination \\nof different chemotherapy drugs are likely to experience more side effects than those who receive a single \\nchemotherapy drug. The main areas of the body affected by chemotherapy  are those where new cells are \\nbeing quickly made and replaced (i.e. bone marrow , hair follicles, the digestive system and the lining of your \\nmouth). Reductions in your levels of neutrophils  (a type of white blood cell) can lead to neutropenia , which \\ncan make you more susceptible to infections.

Please consult your doctor and/or local product prescribing \\ninformation for further details.\\nOther treatments\\nSupportive therapy with bisphosphonates  can result in side effects including flu-like symptoms, renal  toxicity \\nand low calcium levels. Bisphosphonates  can also occasionally lead to osteonecrosis  (death of bone tissues) \\nin the jaw. Although this is very rare, it is important that you clean your teeth regularly and carefully and report \\nany oral problems to your doctor and dentist. Denosumab  therapy can also potentially lead to osteonecrosis  \\nof the jaw, as well as low calcium levels and skin infections. It is crucial that you inform your doctor or nurse \\nwell in advance of any planned dental treatments, as bisphosphonates  and denosumab therapy will have to be \\ntemporarily stopped.'),\n",

Typically, these \\nwill be every 3 4 months in the first 2 years, every 6 \\n8 months from years 3 5 and once a year thereafter \\n(Cardoso et al. 2018 [in press]). During these appointments, \\nyour doctor will review your medical history with \\nyou, note any treatment-related side effects, and \\nconduct a clinical examination. You will also have a \\nmamography every year, and some patients will also \\nhave regular MRI or ultrasound scans. If you are \\ntaking aromatase inhibitors, you will have your bone \\ndensity measured regularly. Based on your results, your doctor will let you know how often you need to return for \\nfurther follow-up appointments. \\nWhat if I need more treatment?\\nCancer that comes back is called a recurrence. The treatment that you will be offered depends on the extent of \\nthe recurrence and the previous treatment(s) you have received. When the tumour  comes back as a recurrence \\nin the breast or surrounding lymph nodes , you may be offered further surgery followed by radiotherapy  and/or \\nsystemic therapy. Recurrent tumours  in distant organs are regarded as metastatic cancers and you can usually \\nhave further systemic  therapy – this may include different drugs to those you were treated with when you were \\nfirst diagnosed, although some patients may receive the same treatments again, especially if they have been free \\nfrom breast cancer for an extended period of time.'),\n",

Give your body \\ntime to recover and make sure you get enough \\nrest, but there is no reason to limit activities if you \\nare feeling well. It is important to take good care \\nof yourself and get the support that you need to \\nresume your normal life, including family activities \\nand work or professional roles.\\nEating a healthy diet and keeping active can help \\nimprove your overall health, fitness and mood. \\nExercising and maintaining your body weight in a healthy range may also reduce your risk of recurrence (Cardoso \\net al. 2018 [in press]). It is important to start slowly, with gentle walking, and build up as you start to feel better. \\nMaintaining a healthy lifestyle through a healthy \\ndiet and regular exercise will help to keep you \\nhealthy and may reduce the risk of recurrence\\nLong-term effects\\nAfter completing treatment for breast cancer, you may experience some long-term side effects, depending on \\nthe treatment you have received – for example radiotherapy  can increase the risk of heart disease and lung \\ncancer and chemotherapy can cause peripheral neuropathy. These long-term effects can be managed so it is \\nimportant that you tell your doctor or specialist nurse  about any persistent or new symptoms. \\nNotably, treatments for breast cancer can cause an early menopause  along with all \\nof the symptoms that are associated with the change in hormone levels, including \\nhot flushes, increased sweating, vaginal dryness and a loss of interest in sex. The \\nmenopause can also contribute to osteoporosis . If you have concerns about early \\nmenopause then you should talk to your doctor or specialist nurse . Hormone \\nreplacement therapy is not normally recommended after breast cancer as it is \\nthought that it could increase the chances of the cancer coming back.\\nFor further information and advice regarding how to regain your life as far as possible \\nafter treatment for cancer, see ESMO’s patient guide on survivorship (ESMO 2017) \\n(http://www.esmo.org/Patients/Patient-Guides/Patient-Guide-on-Survivorship). \\nWhat does \\nsurvivorship mean?\\nLet us explain \\nit to you.\\nesmo.org\\nESMO Patient Guide Series\\nbased on the ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines\\nSurvivorship\\nIn collaboration with'),\n",

Invasive \\nbreast cancer is also called early-\\nstage breast cancer. \\nWhat is invasive breast \\ncancer?\\nBreast cancer starts in the cells of the breast. \\nOver time, these cells form a mass called a \\ntumor. In invasive breast cancer, cancer has \\ngrown outside the milk ducts or milk glands \\n(lobules) into the surrounding breast tissue. \\nOnce outside the ducts or lobules, breast \\ncancer can spread through lymph or blood to \\nlymph nodes or other parts of the body.\\nAlmost all invasive breast cancers are \\ncarcinomas—cancers that start in the cells that \\nline the inner or outer surfaces of the body. \\nThere are different types of breast carcinoma, \\nmost of which arise in cells that make up the \\nlining (epithelial cells) in the terminal duct \\nlobular units (TDLUs) of the breast. A TDLU \\nconsists of a lobule connected to the end of \\na small milk duct. The most common types of \\ninvasive breast cancer are ductal carcinoma \\nand lobular carcinoma.\\nAnyone can develop breast cancer, including \\nthose assigned male at birth. Although there \\nare some differences between breast cancers \\nin those assigned male and those assigned \\nfemale at birth, treatment is very similar for all \\ngenders.\\nThe breast\\nThe breast is a glandular \\norgan made up of milk \\nducts, fat, nerves, blood \\nand lymph vessels, \\nligaments, and other \\nconnective tissue.'),\n",

Behind the breast are the \\npectoral (chest) muscle and ribs. Muscle and \\nligaments help hold the breast in place.\\nBreast tissue contains glands that can make \\nmilk. These milk glands are called lobules. \\nLobules look like tiny clusters of grapes. Small \\ntubes called ducts connect the lobules to the \\nnipple.\\nThe ring of darker breast skin in the center \\nof the breast is called the areola. The raised \\ntip within the areola is called the nipple. The \\nnipple-areola complex (NAC) is a term that \\nrefers to both parts. \\nLymphatic fluid (lymph) drains from breast \\ntissue into lymph vessels and travels to lymph \\nnodes near your armpit (axilla). Lymph is a \\nclear fluid that gives cells water and food. \\nIt also helps to fight germs. Nodes near the \\narmpit are called axillary lymph nodes (ALNs). \\nCancer cells can travel through blood and \\nlymph to lymph nodes and other parts of the \\nbody. \\nWhat's in this book?\\nThis book is organized into the following \\nchapters:\\nChapter 2: Testing for breast cancer \\nprovides an overview of tests you might \\nreceive, and the role of HER2 status, hormone \\nreceptors, genetic cancer risk, and biomarker \\ntesting.\\nChapter 3: Breast cancer staging \\nprovides information on how breast cancer is \\nstaged.\\nChapter 4: Types of treatment gives a \\ngeneral overview of invasive breast cancer \\ntreatment and what to expect. \\nChapter 5: Supportive care gives an \\noverview of what supportive care is and \\npossible side effects of treatment.\\nChapter 6: Your treatment options \\nprovides specific surgery and systemic therapy \\noptions for your cancer based on hormone \\nreceptor (HR) and HER2 tumor status. It also \\ndiscusses who might benefit from systemic \\ntherapy before surgery.\\nChapter 7: The breast after surgery \\noffers more information on volume \\ndisplacement, flat closure, and breast \\nreconstruction.\\nChapter 8: Recurrence explains treatment \\noptions for cancer that has returned.\\nChapter 9: Other resources provides \\ninformation on patient advocacy groups and \\nwhere to get help.\"),\n",

You might consider \\nspeaking with a plastic surgeon \\nbefore surgery. This chapter offers \\nmore information on flat closure \\nand breast reconstruction.\\nThe recovery time for each procedure differs. \\nThis can affect your ability to return to work \\nor participate in activities. You might consider \\nspeaking with a plastic surgeon before surgery \\nto discuss your options and what to expect. \\nA plastic surgeon performs oncoplastic \\n(breast cancer surgery) reductions, balancing \\nprocedures, and breast reconstruction.\\nVolume displacement\\nWith a lumpectomy, most people have a \\nscar with some volume loss. However, if you \\nneed a large lumpectomy and your surgeon \\nthinks your breast will look more abnormal \\nafterwards, your breast may be able to be re-\\nshaped at the time of surgery. This procedure \\nis called volume displacement or oncoplasty. \\nOnly a limited number of cancer centers \\nperform this procedure. It is often done by the \\ncancer surgeon or plastic surgeon right after \\nthe lumpectomy. The surgeon will shift the \\nremaining breast tissue to fill the space left by \\nthe removed tumor.\\nIf volume displacement is planned, a larger \\npiece of your breast will need to be removed. \\nDespite a larger piece being removed, the \\nnatural look of your breast will be kept. \\nHowever, with large amounts of tissue \\nremoved, your breast may be smaller than \\nbefore.\\nYou may not like the results of the volume \\ndisplacement. In this case, breast revision \\nsurgery may help. This surgery is done \\nby a plastic surgeon. A second volume \\ndisplacement may be an option, too. Another \\noption is to get breast implants or mastectomy \\nwith reconstruction.\\nFlat closure\\nIn a total mastectomy with a flat closure, the \\nentire breast, including nipple, extra skin, \\nfat, and other tissue in the breast area, is \\nremoved. The remaining skin is tightened \\nand sewn together. No breast mound is \\ncreated, and no implant is added. The scar \\nwill be slightly raised and differ in color than \\nthe surrounding skin. A flat closure is not \\ncompletely flat or smooth. The result varies \\nfrom person to person. Ask to look at pictures \\nfrom flat closures so you know what to expect. \\nYou might decide to have a flat closure \\nprocedure later or after having breast implants \\nremoved.

In many cases, breast \\nreconstruction involves a staged approach. It \\nmight require more than one procedure.\\nYou may have a choice as to when \\nbreast reconstruction is done. Immediate \\nreconstruction is finished within hours after \\nremoving the breast. Delayed reconstruction \\ncan occur months or years after the cancer \\nsurgery. Reconstruction can also be done in \\nstages, with part of the reconstruction done \\nat the time of the original cancer surgery and \\nfinished with another surgery later. A plastic \\nsurgeon performs breast reconstruction. \\nBreasts can be reconstructed with implants \\nand flaps. All methods are generally safe, \\nbut as with any surgery, there are risks. Ask \\nyour treatment team for a complete list of side \\neffects.\\nImplants\\nBreast implants are small bags filled with salt \\nwater, silicone gel, or both. They are placed \\nunder the breast skin or muscle to look like a \\nnew breast following a mastectomy. A balloon-\\nlike device, called an expander, may be used \\nfirst to stretch out tissue. It will be placed under \\nyour skin or muscle and enlarged every few \\nweeks for 2 to 3 months. When your skin is \\nstretched to the proper size, you will have \\nsurgery to place the final implant.\\nImplants have a small risk of leaking or \\ncausing other issues. You may feel pain from \\nthe implant or expander. Scar tissue or tissue \\ndeath can occur. \\nFlaps\\nBreasts can be remade using tissue from other \\nparts of your body, known as flaps. These flaps \\nare taken from the abdomen, buttocks, thigh, \\nor from under the shoulder blade. Some flaps \\nare completely removed and then sewn in \\nplace. Other flaps stay attached to your body \\nbut are slid over and sewn into place.\\nThere are several risks associated with flaps, \\nincluding death of fat in the flap, which can \\ncause lumps. A hernia may result from muscle \\nweakness. Problems are more likely to occur \\namong those who have diabetes or who \\nsmoke.\\nImplants and flaps\\nSome breasts are reconstructed with both \\nimplants and flaps. This method may give the \\nreconstructed breast more volume to match \\nthe other breast. For any reconstruction, you \\nmay need surgery on your remaining breast to \\nmatch the size and shape of both breasts.\\nNipple replacement\\nLike your breast, a nipple can be remade. To \\nrebuild a nipple, a plastic surgeon can use \\nsurrounding tissues. Also, nipples can be \\nremade with tissue from the thigh or the other \\nnipple. Tissue can be darkened with a tattoo to \\nlook more like a nipple. It is important to note \\nthat while you can remake something to look \\nlike a nipple, it will not have the sensation of \\nyour real nipple. Also, a tattoo can be done to \\nlook like a nipple without having to take tissue \\nfrom another part of the body.'),\n",

In free flap \\nreconstruction, smoking increases the risk \\nof complications. You are encouraged to \\nstop smoking prior to reconstruction.\\n \\x86 Breast size and shape – There are \\nlimits to the available sizes of breast \\nimplants. Very large breasts or breasts \\nthat lack tone or droop (called ptosis) \\nmight be difficult to match.

Supportive care aims to relieve \\nside effects such as pain and to improve \\nquality of life.\\nLocal recurrence \\nTreatment for cancer that has returned to the \\nsame breast as before is based on if your \\nfirst treatment was breast-conserving surgery \\n(lumpectomy) or a mastectomy. More surgery \\nmight be an option. If you had radiation \\ntherapy before, then it may or may not be \\npossible to have radiation again in the same \\narea, which may limit your surgical options.\\nRegional recurrence\\nIf the recurrence is in or near the armpit \\n(axilla), then surgery to remove the tumor \\nmight be an option before radiation therapy. \\nSystemic therapy might be given before \\nsurgery to help reduce the amount of cancer or \\nthe size of the tumor. Treatment after surgery \\nmight include radiation therapy to the lymph \\nnodes. If you had radiation therapy before, \\nthen it may not be possible to have it again to \\nthe same area.\\nBoth local and regional \\nCancer that is both local and regional might \\nbe referred to as a locoregional recurrence. \\nTreatment for a locoregional recurrence is \\nsurgery and radiation therapy followed by \\nsystemic therapy.\\nUnresectable \\nAn unresectable tumor cannot be removed \\nwith surgery. It is treated with systemic therapy. \\nFor treatment of unresectable recurrent \\ndisease, see NCCN Guidelines for Patients: \\nMetastatic Breast Cancer, available at NCCN.\\norg/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient \\nGuides for Cancer app.'),\n",
